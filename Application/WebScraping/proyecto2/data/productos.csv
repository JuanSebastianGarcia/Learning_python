Paired with a 4k 120hz tv, this thing rules.  Download is somewhat slow with WiFi, but connect to a Ethernet cable and it’s fine.  I don’t play a huge amount of games, so the built in storage is fine for me.  It’s just a great platform.///Long Installation & Download///Bought as a Birthday present and thought we can play a little after the dinner party. One hour in installation - does not seem getting closer. Joystick is nice, but not designed to type multiple passwords on the screen for sure. Then downloading the game takes another hour. Just abandoned the effort.Also in the digital edition the games are super expensive $60-$100 per game, while you can buy cds for $25.///Very good Xbox///Very nice good one///tanto server same as ps5///save your money same as ps5  same server TANTO real bad not any better and you gotta start at 0 points some games are ok but most no good not good for COD///Super Fast Delivery///The New Series X Digital looks so good in Robot white. Gaming is what you'd expect. AMAZING!"

BROOOOOOOOOOO, let me say this: DO IT.Faster load times... LIKE SIGNIFICANTLYGames are beautiful... take a game like Fortnite, that's pretty basic... mannnn, Fortnite is lowkey a beautiful game on next-gen.Smooth, like butter graphics. I played The Division 2 last night and I felt like John Wick.The only thing was waiting for the first game to download. It was like an 80GB one.If you've got ULTIMATE, there's NO REASON to not buy a next gen console, the money you save on games, grab the upgrade. 4k (although not true 4k, but who's counting pixels) is amazing. My eyes actually need to adjust to the clarity. Lol.///Forced to install updates you don’t want///This console was a brick the day it was released. As usual, Microsoft is years behind its competitors. I don’t even know why I was stupid enough to purchase one. The biggest issue is that in order to play games you purchased, you must constantly update them. That’s ridiculous. Why? It was working just fine. The other issue is that it continues to take up more and more space. I regret few things in life, but purchasing this junk has to be on the top. Save yourself some headache and buy a different system.///Great gaming system///Fast gaming system really like it. You can play a lot of games on here///Great///Arrived on time and works great.///cadeau arrivé à l'avance///arrivé  sans délai...et c'est un des premiers que je trouvais qui se vendait pas trop cher avec la manette et le câble inclus , ne reste qu'à l'essayer !"
Xbox Series X Console (Renewed),US$449.99,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Xbox-X-Console-Renewed/dp/B0CJ3XWXP8/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BhhlnlbXGtfp-fhLm1erHoKq6hoJBfMMmlPW2VhISqZoTcLyK1oRJshCX2CZIBBM5fJnWyfYy83GSnhSAIccSJcV8KMybl7_qGWAMh3SfegtcpdcFzzleGlgCS0GXLAR8jwN8UtnryW05r1RD6CBpcoaamwYL0U81Kg6fbdeiT8VG9JSKEJSUczcNb67Ywq7Kbi6GKkAiCZzUf2BRHbrtxHhPYCX1C_oc9JFzYqoe-8.kElLdiPKyAqPYCv3-RTVC7peNMAnjk6wpDx6k-SaPYk&dib_tag=se&keywords=xbox&qid=1731040840&sr=8-3,"Quality console///Works like new. Not a single scratch or scuff, very happy. Loved the no hassle financing, would love to see the same type no credit check financing. Would be awesome to have this option on more big ticket items.///Great quality for a Refurbished/Renewed Console///I will update if this changes on anyway.Got to be honest, I thought for a moment I was getting a brand new never before used console. Packaging was great, all smelled new and it was neat and flawless. The only way to know you have a Refurbished/Renewed console is by reading about it on the box on a corner with not so big letters that says ""Refurbished""Device is accompanied by a new controller and both HDMI and Power Cord (which all seemed new).At my house my kids and I have been using it for an average of 6 hours daily and so far it is working great. I am now considering getting a fan to maintain device temperature even lower (and extend life).Just in case, get the assurion extended warranty, as I did. You never know how will time affect the refurbished unit and, at around $49 for 3 years of worry free use? No brainer. (PS. it just has 90day warranty out of the box. Prime Day deal had this unit at 369+tax. There are some other Used ""Like New"" Xbox's from Amazon that brings a whole year warranty.)///Broke down  in 3 days///I ordered this refurbished Series X during Prime days. It is the same Microsoft refurbished Series X you get on the official Xbox website. I didn’t know that until I received the package which is a sealed Microsoft Series X refurbished package.Aesthetically everything was in very very good conditions. The controller looked brand new.It worked fine for about 3 days then it shutdown during a game session and refused to restart. I tried unplugging it, pressing the power button for 30 secs, change outlet … nothing. The console would turn on for a sec and immediately shutdown again.It appears it’s a known power supply issue if Reddit is to be believed, pretty common on earlier units. The one I received had a service date sticker of Mar 2022 if it makes any difference and I would hope they’d have fixed it.Anyway I returned it less than 4 days since delivery, I wouldn’t mind trying a second one just in case I was unlucky but without the extra Prime Days discount it’s just not interesting to me and there was no option for a replacement just for a refund.My experience with this has been bad, a refurbished console should be able to work for more than 3  days of light use, I doubt I had more than 1 hour of play a day out of it aside initial setup.This was sold and shipped by Amazon so not sure who’s to blame … this refurbished business seems to be very hit or miss (bought an Amazon Premium Renewed OLED Switch months ago and that has had no issues but a refurbished One X from 3rd party would overheat in minutes and now this refurbished Series X breaking down so soon …. very very frustrating and disappointing)///Me and my friend bought two Xbox’s///Me and my friend bought 2 Xbox’s and we’ve had them for 3 months now and it’s been great I’ve had no issues at all and I saved a lot of money I would highly recommend it they both run like new///Xbox X series///This xbox is like a brand new xbox I've had no issues at all for it to have been renewed or refinished or whatever.  I am very pleasantly surprised. Iwanted to give a review once I've used it for more than 30 days.///Quality product///The past reviews had me a little worried about buying a refurbished Xbox. But when it arrived, it looked flawless and started right up, no problems. Been playing on it for a few hours now and it’s been fine, absolutely no issues. Will update if I run into any problems.///honest human review///Shipment was delayed supposed to come in on sunday came on Thursday. Did come in thought UPS not amazon. At first of putting in power cord and HDMI cord ( HDMI cord did work) it would not turn on, but after inserting and plugging the power cord of the xbox off and on several times it did eventually work and then turned on. When it turned on it did restart itself twice but after worked completely normal. After all that no issues came from the xbox. Games like college football and Jedi Survivor has worked smoothly and download speed runs fast. Actually would recommend especially during prime day. A Xbox S 1TB was 350 no shipping while this on prime day in 2024 was 400 with shipping so definitely worth but can be risky with all the other reviews in place. Risk it though because this is way more worth it.///Nice!///Was a little worried about buying a renewed xbox on amazon but this thing came in perfect condition and looked like it had never been used before. would 100% buy again///Great Christmas gift for my son!///This Xbox Series X Console was a renewed edition, you can't even tell the difference. It looks brand new just like a new console and everything works great. It has 1TB storage and the games all downloaded pretty quick. My son was very happy and excited to receive this this Xbox series X console, it was a surprise for him and an early Christmas Gift from Me. It was shipped in 2 business days and arrived at my doorstep 2 days after it was ordered. Now that is what you call fast shipping. It was a good investment for my son and he loved it! Thank you To The Seller!///Good renewed///It's working great, loving it. Just hate that I bought a Sealan monitor that had false advertising to go with it. It's 1080p and my Xbox is 8k. They lied.///Stopped working!!! Don't waste ur money!!!///My daughter saved up all year to purchase this! Played for a month. Started having the issue of not turning on a couple weeks in but thought maybe it was the controller. The console won't start now. No matter what we're tried. I wish she had spent money on the warranty.  She's so down about losing so much money on what should be considered garbage! Don't waste ur money on the Xbox X console!!!!///Xbox Series X: A Budget-Friendly Beast of a Console!///After spending some time with the Xbox Series X, I’m really impressed with what it brings to the table. This console definitely lives up to the hype as a powerhouse. From the moment I started using it, the performance was top notch. Games run smoothly in 4K, and it stays impressively quiet (I have a PS5 for comparison) even during intense gaming sessions.One thing that really stood out to me is how well it handles heat. Even in the middle of a recent heatwave, the Xbox Series X stayed cool and didn’t overheat, which is a huge plus. The build quality feels solid it’s sturdy and durable, which gives me confidence that it’ll last a long time.The controller is another highlight. It feels incredibly rugged and well-built, almost like it could take a beating and still keep going. Overall, the Xbox Series X has surpassed my expectations in terms of power and build quality. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a high-end gaming experience without breaking the bank lol. The only downside is the limited number of exclusive titles, but other than that, it’s pretty much perfect. 😄 👍///Awesome///Play a lot of games. Always works great. A little difficult to get going like registration issues. Had to get the neighbors kid to set it up. Once it was working it was great. Of coarse it was pricy but in the long run well worth the money. Zero issues with it over one year now."

This console had great gaming quality and more storage space///This Xbox is amazing.///Omg it works great, fast delivery and well packed. And the price of this Xbox series s was well worth the money. Thank you so very much I am absolutely loving it.///Very incredible///I like the xbox and it comedy with free game pass///Good deal///I mean it’s the Xbox series S.Overall good deal considering the extras!///Works great but game pass doesn’t work///The Xbox came early!! I had no problems setting it up. I haven’t had an Xbox in a couple of years so it did take me a little to relearn how the controller works. I love ittt!!! Only issue is when I try to claim the game pass it says there’s an issue. Ive been trying to figure out the problem for a couple of days but still can’t manage to figure out the problem. Which sucks because that’s one of the main things I was looking forward to. Hopefully I can figure it out soon.///Worth the money///This was a gift for my son who had to upgrade stuff in order to continue to play games.///Giving Credit Where it's Due///Now granted, I don't have a smart 4k state of the art tv, but for the price I got for the brand, I'm satisfied with how games looked on it. This was before playing on the Series S. The games, streaming services, even YouTube looks amazing through the system. Yes, it would be nice to have a Series X for the disc. But I'm really impressed with this little console that could. Not only does it run amazing, the quick resume feature blows my mind everytime I switch from YouTube to a game. I think I'm more impressed with just how quiet this thing is. My former main console was a PS4 Pro. And oh boy, it was like a plane was taking off everytime it need to load. If you have the money for a Series X, I'd say go for it; especially if you can find a sale going for it. But if you don't care for the disc drive or the extra power, you won't be disappointed with the Series S. With this and Game Pass, I'm set for life!///Came early///As i said it arrived early it had a bit on damage on the corners of the box but the console and contents were perfectly fine i love it i boight it because i needed to upgrade from my ps4 and the ps5 is far more expensive but ive loved the xbox exclusives so far its a great console minus its server crashing issues///Great machine///The product was exactly as described. It’s also the fastest loading console I’ve ever owned. I’m very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new console. The only downfall is the amount of space the hard drive has. I was only able to install 2 games on it as they were fairly large games but still being a digital machine it should come with more space. I hope this helps anyone that’s contemplating on a new console…///Works great///Great starter set///🔥🔥🔥///The graphics are crazy. The only bad thing is the storage. I returned this and bought the series x since it and more storage and because I was getting it for $560 including tax on sale lmao."

But the machine works great.///Great price///Great price. Son wnated for his gaming in addition to his computer and this was a great price///Perfect Condition - Bought ""Used-Acceptable"" from Amazon Warehouse///It came in the original box which was a little mangled and taped, but the console and controller were flawless. No issues and I am so happy to have saved more than $50. I bought for myself so the box condition wasn't an issue. The codes for Fortnite and Rocket League were unused. The games load so fast now! Happy with my purchase!Please Note: I brought over my external 2 TB hard drive I was using on my Xbox One S for storage. I have found that the newer Xbox Series X-S games will not install on the external hard drive due to the connection speed between the USB attached hard drive is not fast enough (the Xbox will flash a notification that you won't be able to play the game). With the Series S only having 512 GB of internal storage, I have already run out of space on my internal storage as I play mainly Grand Theft Auto V, Fallout 76, and Conan Exiles. So I will have to buy the Seagate Storage Expansion Card which will be another $150 plus.  This is not a deal breaker, but I wanted to share.///Excellent console but series s n x arent worth upgrade from xbox one x///Honestly, i think the Series S is a superb/great console.Only two cons, cost of external plug-in drive to overcome seriously ludicrous limited memory capacity (no excuse for not having 1TB in S and 2TB in X in modern day) AND its gameplay  speed (Series S n Series X) is really not THAT much better than xbox one x.Aside from faster load times, I really dont see a major difference in performance in series s and an ssd equipped one x. Xbox series x is also not all that without 4k tv n, even with the fancy new tv, its really not that super-impressive. If i had it to do over again, aside from the series x as a surprise gift, i’d have been happy with the Series S and 1tb plug-in drive. Seagate, i think?BUT, aside from moderately faster load times, without games written specifically for these 2 new console iterations, just put an ssd in your xbox one x and keep running it until you HAVE to change up. Maybe the plug in ssd will be more affordable then and id say do that with a series s n enjoy it.To do it again? Id just keep jamming w my one x with high speed ssd. Unfortunately, im prolly giving mine to one of my Destiny clanmates who seriously needs a new console. He sherpas lfg alot of people (looking for game) through raids (like me n i super suck) so its a good cause.I'm on an xbox series x which i got from my sister as a surprise gift. Between series S and X? I’d go with Series S and 1tb expansion card n give my one x to my clanmate. Save the stress n cash n skip the Series X. Use that cash to get a 20th Anniversary or Series 2 Elite Controller to go with your new sweet Series S. Or, put it towards the memory expansion card.Since I've played all 3 n switched back n forth over the last month, i thought I’d share my wisdom. Good luck with your decision n remember, as always, ymmv.///Good!///Other than the little booklet being ripped everything is brilliant, considering i ordered it from the uk and got it in under a week. Dark skully was on there so definitely not a scam. I did notice the box was roughed up but i don't mind as I'm not a collector. I do hope I don't have to come back in some months to say the xbox has died as i have noticed some people saying it breaks down weeks to months later. But so far it's turned on and worked well.///Not the one i wanted but it came brand new///I originally ordered the “midnight drive” drive pack but ended up getting the wrong bundle but everything works and i got everything so i cant complain///It’s an Xbox///Received fairly quick , can’t say much it’s an Xbox.  It works and I’m happy . Go get you one from Amazon///Xbox series S///I'm actually blown away by this, I'd switched over to PlayStation with the last generation but the Xbox series S is the absolute best performance you can get for its price it's super fast and not stupid expensive. Only downside is the hard drive has about 360gb of usable storage the rest is reserved for the OS, backwards compatibility and the quick resume. It boosts a lot of 360 games that was enough for me and I got so much more///Was 100% sceptical///Okay, I was beyond skeptics because this was at least 200$ cheaper than wal-mart, Best Buy, game stop and other electronic sellers. But after reading reviews I took a chance and ordered. Well!! I’m not disappointed in the slightest!! Not only is this a legitimate Xbox series S, it works amazing! And delivery was ridiculously FAST!! Thank heavens for Amazon partnering with Microsoft, saved a ton of money!! If you’re skeptics, don’t be! Make that purchase and save some money for a super cute controller or headset!DO IT!///Best///Best brand of game console. Xbox is #1"

I am extremely disappointed because my nephew have been waiting for days, and when I went to his house to set it up, IT DID NOT WORK. He was soo disappointed. So embarrassing 🥹😢I guess the reviews are real and honest. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt///Console Fine, Controller A Different Story///Arrived on time as expected, console came in excellent condition however the controller looked new still but the X and Y button is stuck and arrived that way. I was forced to put out another $60 for a new controller that I shouldn't have had to buy seeing how I paid $240 for the set. Came with NO controller battery and came with NO cord to attach the controller to the console to play.  For the price it should have came with those or at least one of those. Included HDMI cable wasn't even over 12"" long which doesn't do anybody any good unless you want to Velcro or strap the console to the back of the TV near the HDMI ports since it doesn't since it has no VESA mount. I just think the seller tries to cut corners. I mean how did he or she not see that 2 of the buttons were stuck before shipping it to me. Listed as excellent condition should not have stuck buttons on the controller. With that being said I have no clue how much longer the console will even last, I'm thinking of returning it and just forking out the Extra 2 bucks for new X series because I ordered the Xbox One X and received just the Xbox One.///Amazing///I was very skeptical about purchasing a renewed Xbox One we bought it for my granddaughter as we are about to move, we opened it this morning it is completely wrapped and bubble wrap the wires taped nicely and the controller perfect condition we set it up just to make sure it works it didn't take long at all to get it set up on the TV loaded a game and let the kids play two games before we took it apart this Xbox looks completely brand new I highly recommend buying from this seller!! Can't wait to get moved where she can have her own Xbox in her room very happy with my purchase///Great system///Was pleased with the system we received. Both the console and the controller work very well. The seller also included extras in the package which we did not expect.///.///It came perfectly fine exactly what i ordered and Works fine in My opinion it's worth it to Buy it///Did not work///Tried several times to get this set up and had to return it for a refund."
Xbox 360 250GB Slim Console - (Renewed),US$154.99,3.8,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Xbox-360-250GB-Slim-Console-Renewed/dp/B00LPWW9VK/ref=sr_1_11?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BhhlnlbXGtfp-fhLm1erHoKq6hoJBfMMmlPW2VhISqZoTcLyK1oRJshCX2CZIBBM5fJnWyfYy83GSnhSAIccSJcV8KMybl7_qGWAMh3SfegtcpdcFzzleGlgCS0GXLAR8jwN8UtnryW05r1RD6CBpcoaamwYL0U81Kg6fbdeiT8VG9JSKEJSUczcNb67Ywq7Kbi6GKkAiCZzUf2BRHbrtxHhPYCX1C_oc9JFzYqoe-8.kElLdiPKyAqPYCv3-RTVC7peNMAnjk6wpDx6k-SaPYk&dib_tag=se&keywords=xbox&qid=1731040840&sr=8-11,"Easy to setup and works perfectly///I bought this to finally be able to hook it up and play some old Xbox game discs I had scattered around the house. The game graphics for an old copy of Lost Odyssey look perfect even to this day on the Xbox. The console might be a bit scratched here and there, but I don't really mind as it came will all the needed cables for an easy setup in under 5 minutes.///Updated review!///I had to update, as my review was focused on my refund. Maybe I should have said customer service. I believe all aspects of purchase are important as a consumer.The Xbox did not work (this is seller related and not just product review) I was not that bothered with it and was just going to replace it (also showing I still had confidence with the seller). I found another option and requested a refund ( this is product related). I will stop there, as the length of time the refund took was not important according to Amazon.So, to summarize: product did not work, was offered a replacement or refund, found another option and requested a refund! Took too long with no communication.I am hoping the ‘story’ and short version summary show that it is product, seller and customer service related.///Xbox 360 works///I really liked that it works and has no issues even the hard drive is 500gb which is a plus lol only issue is that the controller has one bumper that isn't working bur over all very happy with the item///Excellent product!///Bought this console to replace a nonfunctional one and was amazed at the outstanding graphics quality that was degrees above my old one when it was brand new!  Nice to have a great refurbished 360 to be able to enjoy my old favorites again!  Outstanding transaction and fast shipping!///Great! (So far)///Bought this model back in 2013 or so, preowned from GS. It has worked great until the other day, oddly enough the fan starting getting way to loud and sounded like it had/has a bad bearing. Sometimes it will work, but eventually just cranks right back up again. And runs far to hot. Ebay is horrible for consoles and all the GS models are sold out, even still you usually get junk from there these days. Smelly, dirty, marked up and really bad over all. So I came here saw this model, read about what they do to them, and took a chance.I'm glad I did, it showed up in less than 3 days, and does look flawless. Everything is nice and cleaned up, scuffs and scratches are barely noticeable even close us. Runs quiet and cool. Also the controller is like brand new. And I thought the one I had was in great shape. The one problem was the power supply (power brick), it was very loose around the whole case itself and rattles inside, but it was easily rectified by just using the one I have. I may ask if this company will send me another, but they are pretty easy to find anyway. If I wanted an extra. So hopefully mine will hold old. I have a series x, PS4 Pro, and a few other old systems but this is the only older one I use. It's great for obscure games that didn't cross over to Xbox One/Series X. I seem to be addicted to Wheel Of Fortune, since I've played it nearly every night since 2015. And I'm up to 57 million dollars! Didn't want to lose that!! ha. So I put in my old HDD and everything worked perfectly, easy transfer. Also I still love Tiger Woods Golf, old Forza 4, and some other good old games. So yes, imo the price is fine. Not sure what all the one star complaints are about. Especially when you really don't have a choice. And these are like new! But we'll see how it goes before I make that final call. Give it a few months. But as of now though, it's great!///Almost had to return it///The regular power cord did not work thankfully I had another one from my previous Xbox 360. So no return was needed. It did not come with a cord charger for the remote but I still made it work.///My childhood : )///People say that this Xbox is no good mine was good it came with no scratches no marks the cords work and definitely no dead bugs in the controller adapter this is a good Xbox and I got it to play my childhood games some have not arrived yet though but this is no issue 😀 so far I have been able to play Mortal Kombat vs DC universe, Forza 2 motorsport and Marvel's ultimate alliance. There are no issues with this 360 and at a cheap price it's an awesome piece that I'm definitely gonna keep good Job everybody! 5 STARS! 🙂🙂///Dubiously rebuilt and expensive for what it is///I've bought this 360 as a backup to my original I've owned for the better part of 15 years, especially in light of the looming shutdown of XBLA. On the outside the console looks excellently maintained and well kept, however booting up the console the system loads into the OS version from 2011. This on the surface was not an issue, however the system would not update from the internet nor accept either of my XBL accounts for console or PC. This is not an unheard of issue and so I burned the updates from 2019 onto a disc and copied them onto a hard drive if the former did not work. The console would begin the updates from the flash drive only to still give the same response as downloading from the internet. After perusing forums and trying multiple ways for two days after work, the general support issue I've found is that this is a common problem with improperly formatted or set up replacement parts. I may not be able to confirm this due to me not wanting to damage the console but the system cannot even play Dragon Age Origins or create a new profile without demanding an update that crashes it or forces you back to the dashboard. This is not a 360 Slim issue, as my other 360 is an identical model save for some stickers and minor finish blemishes from more than a decade of taking the console to friend's houses. Moreover it also started effectively with the same version of the OS. If you want an Xbox 360 I'd implore you to look for one at your local video game store which unless I can repair this one is likely where I'll be trading it for a working one, unfortunately."

Pretty nice set. Quite happy with it///All parts seem to be pretty high quality. Everything but the paddles fit really well. Paddles seem to be a little loose though. In a noticeable way but not in an unusable way. All the other buttons work well. Case looks and feels just like the original but a bit taller. It seems the charging dock charges faster than the original. I didn't time this but it sure seems to be faster. Charging dock has quite a bit of weight to it just like the original. The magnet on the case for the charging dock is stronger on the original. Anodizing on the metal parts is nice. Metal parts have a nice matte finish. If I had another controller I would definitely get another set of these. Very happy with this and rated it 5 stars.///Good replacement///Everything looks great. Only one minor thing the cable barely fits in case///Great case and accessories for an Elite 2 controller///We got our daughter one of these Elite 2 controllers for her birthday but the Core only came with the controller and a few of the sticks. This is a great way to get a case with charging dock that all fits inside this OEM looking case. My daughter loves the case and that it has all the different sticks and paddles to now configure her controller the way she wants it.

Transfer speed is so fast.///If you switch between a lot of large games, this is perfect. Instead of deleting and redownloading, you can just swap a game out in about ten minutes, extremely convenient.///Perfect Solution for Expanding Xbox Series X/S Storage///The Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB SSD for Xbox series consoles has been an absolute game-changer for my Xbox Series X. Here’s why I’m impressed:Pros: Seamless Integration: The plug-and-play functionality is outstanding. Just pop it into the storage expansion slot at the back of the console, and you’re good to go. No setup, no hassle.Performance: This SSD provides the same performance as the internal storage, with no noticeable difference in load times or gameplay. Games load quickly, and I haven’t experienced any lag or performance issues.Storage Capacity: The 2TB capacity is a lifesaver for someone like me who loves downloading and playing multiple games. It effectively triples my storage space, which means I can keep all my favorite games installed without constantly juggling storage.Build Quality: The card feels robust and well-made. The design is compact, and it fits snugly into the console without sticking out awkwardly.Future-Proof: As more games come out with larger file sizes, having this extra storage ensures that I’m ready for any new releases without worrying about space constraints.Cons: There is only one Price: The only drawback is the cost. It’s on the pricier side, but considering the convenience and performance, I believe it’s worth the investment for serious gamers. Also there is a 1 Month Game Pass Ultimate code included inside the box that makes it a overall better value.Conclusion: The Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB SSD is a must-have for any Xbox Series X/S owner who needs additional storage. It delivers on performance, ease of use, and build quality. Despite the higher price point, it’s a worthy investment for the convenience and seamless gaming experience it provides. Highly recommended for gamers looking to expand their storage without compromising on performance.///Excellent product///I finally decided to get an Xbox Series X, and even though it was the 2tb version of the console I needed additional memory. The seagate 2tb expansion card is a very reliable item that downloads games and apps at quick speeds, and it hasn't given me any issues to this point, The only issue that I have is that I'm already running out of memory and would've gone the 4tb expansion card route if seagate offered such an item. In summary it's a great item that I would highly recommend, but seagate needs to offer a 4tb version of this item.///finally my XBOX works great///the other drive was not xbox compatible, now ALL games work.///A necessity that cost way too much.///Let me start by saying this is an excellent device and if you're a gamer or have more than one person using the Xbox, it's an actual requirement.Pros - Easy to use (plug and play), lots of space, very fast, necessary for Xbox Series optimized games.Con - Only one con. PRICE! Even though the price has dropped, it's still far more expensive than it needs to be, especially when you consider that the PS5 has ones that are double this capacity and faster for the same price or this size for far less. (the caveat with the PS5 is that you have to open the case and screw it in whereas this one is literally just plug it in, but hardly worth the extra price). As games get larger, game pass gets even more games and the push for digital over physical media continues, you can't help but feel gouged by the price on this one. The new prices are much better but far from perfect and after this amount of time, it's hard to justify that it's not cheaper to create these and that should be passed to the consumer.///Expensive yes but it’s well worth the price///I like it a lot gives me more storage space for my games and the capability to add more.///Works perfectly!///Works just as intended.!!!NOTE!!! Series X/S optimised games CAN NOT be played directly from the storage! Only games compatible on older Xbox consoles can be played from the storage. ❤Moving big games only takes a few minutes, and it's super easy to do!///Best Hard Drive!///In December 2023, I bought a similar hard drive from Seagate but when I moved from New York to Florida in June of this year I lost it, luckily after some digging on Amazon I was able to find the same hard drive, and bought it when I needed extra space for my video games in July. What I like about this hard drive is how easy it was to connect to my Xbox One S, there was no hassle and I loved how much storage there was, if you need a hard drive for your Xbox I suggest buying from Seagate, these guys make the best hard drives on the market.///Loved it!///My son loves the added memory for his Xbox games. Just works perfectly.///Lots of extra storage.///I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a damaged box - not in original box item. I managed to save around $40 dollars Canadian from the original sale price which I felt was a good deal. I am happy to report that the expansion card did arrive in its original box which was slightly damaged. However the card itself did not have a scratch on it and the internal holder packaging was not damaged in any way. The expansion card worked immediately, I just plugged it in to the back of the Series X and it was recognized right away. It was great because I was immediately able to move around 40 Series X only games to the card. It was amazing to see a game transferring to the card (only for about 10 second) at 8.5gigs a second, it evened out at about 6gigs a second which is still very incredible. Have been using it now for a couple of months, very fast load times and moving games back and forth. Has allowed me to try many of the Series X only games I had stored on an external 16T hard drive without having to constantly move games back and forth. My only complaint is that these Expansion cards from Seagate and Western Digital are still quite expensive even after 3-4 years on the market, hopefully they will continue to drop in price. All in all a great upgrade in storage option for the Series X and S. Would definitely recommend.///The price is right///Very easy to use arrived on time and love the light"

Sounds good and i could hear everything i needed to hear, friends said the mic was pretty decent and they could hear me nice and clear on the other end. Seem to be pretty good material too, again given the price it should hold up dif you treat them like you paid for them.Pretty comfortable too, after a long night of origional zombies i never really noticed they were their. Light, ear cushions are nice and cushiony, headbands actually comfy and not as annoying as i thought it would be. Looooooong cord too, almost annoying long lol but gives you plenty of movement thats for sure.///It's a pretty solid headset (preferably as a backup but could be used as a main)///I have been using this head set for about a month now and it's a pretty durable headset with decent mic and speakers for a good price. I absolutely love the ear pads. When looking for a gaming head set I usually have an issue with the breathability of the headphones most of the time because my ears get too hot or the material makes me uncomfortable after prolonged use, but these were perfect. The speakers are great, I usually look for surround sound headphones for directional listening for games but this actually work just as good. Also music is pretty good although i haven't heard incredible bass from if your curious about that. I have only three major complaints, well not really complaints but fears I have regarding the velcro band that your head rests on, the mic and the wire. The velcro strap is pretty stretchy and comfortable but I'm kinda concerned about  it stretching out over time and the headset not sitting on my head properly and sliding all over the place. For the mic I'm not concerned about its sound quality, because as I said previously it's pretty good mic though what they said about the directional mic isn't really great I can still hear people in front of me from a distance in my audio's background and they aren't yelling or speaking loudly, another thing to consider when buying this. I'm also concerned with the life expectancy of the mic because it's a pull down to speak and push up to mute, I kinda worried about it breaking cause it's getting looser with my use. I also have problems with the aux cord when plugging it in to my laptop, tablet, or controller. Sometimes it acts like it isn't plugged in or makes static noises only heard by my teamates when I'm talking and gets worse when I have the mic up. But otherwise I say it's a pretty good set of gaming headphones for the price.Update: 7/3/2024The head phones started to have a static noises one one side of the headphones, the mic surprisingly didn't  have issues and as I feared the band started strech out and now it slides off my head pretty often.///Solid///The first pair that arrived did not work at all so I returned them and got a replacement. Second pair works find and I’m glad I got a replacement instead of asking for my money back.The most I game in a session is 2 hours and they are plenty comfortable for that amount of time. Haven’t had any complaints about mic quality. The quality of the plastic is pretty good. I’d recommend for the price.///Works great///Bought them for my wife , and she says the fit great and the sound is great. No complaints///Love it///The headband fit is so extremely comfortable and the ear sections are great for people with ear piercings that get compressed with other headphones. Can wear these for long gaming sessions and forget they are there! The muting feature is also amazing!///Actually Pretty Good but…///Pretty good sounding headset and comfortable too but I wish it had a mute button the only way to mute is to lift the mic up///Needs additional equipment to work on PC!///Nowhere in the product description did it mention it needed a separately purchased dual 3.5mm splitter for this to work with a PC. I know we're just talking about budget headphones and this didn't break my bank.. but I would have purchased the splitter at the time of the headphones instead of now having to go get one, or order one and continue to wait just to use headphones on the PC.///So impressed I bought a second pair///Overall, I've been very impressed with these headphones. They are some of the most comfortable gaming headphones I have owned. They have a reversable band that can be used as multicolored or black. They fit over my ears very comfortably. The mic works well without interference. I like that you can simply flip it up to mute it. It's very convenient during gaming, rather than a switch on the cord like others I have used. I have used the headset with my Xbox X and I have had no issues. Sound quality is very good with an easy to access volume scroll wheel. My husband used them a few times and liked them so much I bought him a pair. Overall, these are a great option for gaming headphones.///Excellent budget headset!///I'm so happy with these! For only $60 (CAD) this headset has it all.If you're looking at $40 headsets, spend another $20 (if you can) and get this one instead!It's comfortable, soft, eyeglasses friendly, does not squeeze my head. My ears fit inside the deep ear cups, they do not touch the hard part inside, and my glasses aren't being pushed around! Adjustable headband is stretchy and smooth.Sound quality is great for this price, too! You could happily listen to music on an iPod or your phone with these. They might not get as loud as an expensive Bluetooth headset but dude; for $60?! These are fantastic!The microphone is loud & clear, and it doesn't pick up sound from the headphones!I bought these for use on a smartphone mostly.I have tested the mic and sound on a phone call, in WhatsApp, and in Capcut. It all sounded better than I expected for a budget headset, and I didn't get background noise on my voice recordings.I'm told my microphone in the phone call came through surprisingly crisp and clear, way better than my phone's built-in mic.The braided cord is a really nice touch, and the set is so light! It weighs basically nothing.Because they're so light I wouldn't recommend letting them bounce around loosely in a bag, just treat them with care.Good job, JLAB! I'm gonna be using these all the time! 10/10! Thank you!///COMFY and great sound///Using these for ps5 and I love them so much. They're padded and extremely comfortable. Occasionally I use them for music and they sound pretty good too.///Audio correct mais micro médiocre///Booster le micro à 30dB pour entendre peu non merci… mais l’audio est bien mais Le micro ne vaut vraiment pas la peine, résultat final remboursement 😞"

Looks cool with the front lights and charges great. Have had it for over a year and it’s still working great.///Excellent rechargeable battery///This was easy to install and set up. The only issue was the battery fits very tight so make sure you completely snap it into place. At first the controllers didn't work because I didn't have the batteries completely seated. Once I figured that out they worked great.No performance issues. So far battery charge holds for about 16 to 18 hours of gaming. They fit fine on the charger cradle which I have plugged into the USB port on the Xbox Series X.I like the indicator light telling me when it's charging and when it's fully charged and it seems accurate so far. a big plus is how inexpensive this is compared to burning through AA batteries non stop.  Great value.///Works great!///No more dead batteries when I go to play Xbox! Just set the controller on the charger when you’re done and it’s always ready to go the next time you pick it up.///Works great///Purchased this to use it for the controller I use for my PC. It works great and the battery lasts a long time. The only thing I wish it had was a way to charge the secondary battery without a controller so that way if you needed to you could swap them out.///Does as advertised.///Put about forty hours on it already. No issues. Batteries fit like a glove. Charges like a champ. Highly satisfied. Would recommend.///Having issues charging?///If you are getting the fast blinking red light when you put the controller on the charger, try turning the battery so the arrow points in the other direction. The instructions were confusing about which direction to insert the battery, so initially I had mine pointing the wrong way. The controller worked fine, but would not charge on the charger, and I had the fast blinking red light indicating a charging issue. After I turned the battery the other way, all is good and the controller charges on the charger as expected.///Works great!///Product is great.  Not sure if I overlooked this detail but please note that it does not come with a box to plug it in!!///Great charger///Comes with black battery covers so you may need to drill holes in your custom battery covers///Sensacional///Exatamente como descrito.///Perfeito///A duração das baterias é de 43 horas de jogatina, muito bom.///Work good!///Good! Works very good so far after 2 monthsThe question with todays stuff, is always for how long///Durabilidade das baterias excelentes.///Base muito prática e simples de instalar.

I missed the second set of covers for the xbox series controllers and thought there was a problem but then I found them and they fit my xbox series controller fine and the other ones fit my xbox one controller fine. Everything is working abd charging like it should.///Works perfectly with my Xbox Series S controllers.///My controllers easily fit on this charger perfectly even with the rubber case on them. At first I was gonna return this for a full refund cause I saw no matter how long I keep on charging them even with the light showing green, my Xbox Series S always shows the battery life as Medium, not full. Only much later I found out that this is normal for lots of 3rd party rechargeable batteries to never show up as 100% charged on other devices, even though the charger light is green meaning that it is 100% charged.So I've been using the controller with the pink rubber for the last 4 nights, and whenever I start the games on my Xbox Series S I always end up playing for at least 5 hours or more, and so far for the past four nights it still shows the battery life in my controller as medium, meaning that it's not even close to needing me to use the charger yet.  So in the end I was wrong for thinking that this charger is no good even though it really is.  I also like that this charger gives you the option to turn off the lights completely if you'd like after charging the controllers, and also you can turn off the lights on the bottom if you'd like and only the two lights on top will stay on to let you know when it's done, if you're still charging the controllers.///Looks and works great!///It looks awesome on my desk and charges great!///Great///Excellent product, battery’s last me 5 days of gaming with no charge and at least 3hrs per day///Easy to connect///All you need to do once you insert the battery is to set the controller on the base. I've had other models that you have to make adjustments once you place the controller. Great!!///Good product///The product looks cool and functions as advertised. I am skeptical how long the battery will last. They appear to be two AA batteries in a thin wrap not hard plastic. If they are put in the controllers and left alone I don't see any issues.///Keeps controllers charged///Not one change of batteries yet!///Great product!///Love it! Works well and zero issues! Keeps both controllers charged up! Batteries last a long time as well!"

I used to burn through AA batteries in both my XB1 and Series X controllers for a long time. I have tried rechargeable kits, but the batteries take so long to recharge in the machines, that I end up having to use another set of AA's in between. I've also utilized other types of chargers/rechargeable batteries in the past, those batteries never lasted very long even when brand new, and charging took almost as long and you had to leave the batteries in the controller, which means the controller is now out of service and you could not even play with a wire attached.This system was designed the right way, with the option to charge the batteries without needing the full controller attached, and because it comes with 4, you have many options available to keep your game going on for a long time. Each individual battery fits the Xbox One and Series X/S controllers, and you do not need any fancy back plate replacement. The batteries slip right in and the controller turns on and you're good to go. Once the battery dies out, pop it into an open green slot, make sure to push it down until it clicks in and the light will turn red to show it is charging, when done it turns green and you're ready to go with that battery again.Upon receiving my charging kit, I placed all batteries in to see how long it would take and very shortly after placing them all on charge, the lights started turning green very quickly. I have been able to test one of the batteries so far to see what the full extent of life would be while playing a few different types of games that make the controller vibrate rather often to see how long it would take and the battery was still going past the 7.5 hour mark without charging it and with the controller only turning off briefly from being away. Once finished gaming for the day, I placed the battery back on the charger and I do not believe it was even 2 hours before the charger turned green again to show it was ready to use.This set up is convenient, it is easy to use as a travel set when gaming with friends on the go, and it a great asset to saving money and not wasting it on disposable batteries as often. The investment is worth it if gaming with an xbox controller if you primary controller whether on console or PC, it is just the way to go because you always have a fresh battery waiting to be utilized, or you can share with friends to keep them gaming in between their batteries being recharged. I'm truly excited to come across this setup and will be putting it to use full time as my new replacement to the older battery kits I've used and suggest for anyone one a budget, the small cost to purchase this up front will save you tons in the future for disposable batteries when your income is definitely not that disposable with all these price hikes on everyday items. Definitely a great item that will benefit gamers all around!///Convenient with a long play time///I’ve been using alkaline batteries to power my Xbox controllers, but that was getting expensive and bad for the environment. Then I started using AA NiMh batteries, but the capacity is small and I have to recharge them often, plus managing a set of AA batteries with a charger is cumbersome. I was interested in this set because the battery packs are neatly packaged together instead of loose AA batteries, and the charging base looks compact and I can leave it sitting next to my Xbox. The charging base can charge all 4 batteries at the same time, and comes with a USB-C charging cable but not an AC adapter.Out of the box, the batteries needed to be charged, so I plugged them all in, and it took a few hours for them to fully charge. The charging well for each battery lights up green when a battery is full and red when a battery is charging. I can see the lights from over ten feet away, so it is easy to tell when the batteries have finished charging.The new batteries only go in one way but easy to figure out. Make sure the printed side that says “Outside” is facing up, and the contact side of the battery goes in first, then the other end will just slide in. It won’t let you insert the battery the wrong way, so never force it.Overall, I like the extra capacity of these batteries, and they give a much longer play time. When the battery runs out, it is simple to swap out a fresh pack, making it very convenient. The charging base is small and unobtrusive, and looks right at home next to my Xbox. If you’re still using alkaline batteries, get this rechargeable set and you will never look back.///Long lasting, quick charging///This battery pack has a lot to like. The charge lasts longer than conventional batteries. The packs are rechargeable, and they are quick charging. The charger station is great! It holds the battery packs snugly in place while there is a red to green LED indicator lighting that shows when the packs are done charging.I use these with my XBox controllers. I get a lot of game time in before I have to switch out the batteries. At first, it might be a little tricky getting the battery pack mounted in the controller. It only fits one way, so once it gets figured out, it's no problem. They fit good once placed correctly. They are easy to remove.The power station uses USB-C as the power cable. The product description says that the battery station and power packs are good for 2,000+ charges. That seems about the going rate for similar products.These packs work well, and I am impressed with the long battery life. It comes with four battery packs, and each fit well with my controllers. The price seems fair. It's been a good product so far. Recommended.///Works great///Prefect for my gamer. Battery life lasts long. Charges quite quick.///So far working great///Xbox controllers go through too many AA’s so we have been trying the rechargeable kind to varying degrees of success. So far these ones are working great.-They came in very well packaged and everything was accounted for.-They came in partially charged so they didn’t take long to reach full charge the first time.-They are a bit tight getting them in the battery compartment but that just means if you don’t put the battery cover on they will still stay in.-As you can see these are the type that charge outside the controller which has a benefit of its own. Instead of having to put your controller down to charge you can just switch the battery.-The fact that these work for several types of controllers is very nice as opposed to the crazy specific other ones we have tried.- They also stay pretty cool and don’t overheat so far.-So far they last at least as long as advertised.Overall I am very happy with the quality of these and the fact we are going through less AA batteries."

There are a few bugs still but nothing that will ruin your experience. My favorite mode is dynasty, and ive enjoyed learning how to properly recruit and pevel your coach up. I would reccommend buying the game in discount instead of the full 70.///Finally back, the OG is still the GOAT///You can do everything you could in the old NCAA games, except with better graphics and licensed player models. What's not to like? Still wish they would do two separate games for Dynasty and CUT. Most who play one ignore the other,  and each could benefit from their own dev team, etc.///Love this///My wife would give this one star due to all the time I have spent playing!  Absolute blast of a game!///College Football is back!!!///Im really loving this game… it’s different than Madden but still a great football game!///EA XBOX Scam///There's literally no way to know this game is not compatible with XBOX ONE, XBOX ONE S, XBOX ONE X since the exact same letters are used over again with other Xbox consoles and they appear to mean the same thing. This was the most deceptive advertising decision I've seen in a long time. I see XBOX losing a lot of customers over this. All they had to do was make this game for xbox one like the Madden game and so mamy other games, but nope, they had to screw everyone with older consoles over.  😒 I just want a refund, but of course, no way to get one because the game has to be opened to find out it doesn't work on some older XBOX One consoles, even if they have X or S in their name. 😡 Look at the percentage of 1 star reviews. People are not happy with this deceptive bait and switch tactic.///Fantastic Game...If you are Playing Online!///As far as the mechanics go this is the best college football game I have ever played. The controls are intuitive. fluid and very easy to use. You don't have to press a button to do a fancy move when you are running for extra yardage. All you have to do is move the control stick in various directions and your player will fight for yardage.  This makes for great balance by allowing the players to finally mix up effective running and passing strategies. The movements of the players are so realistic. You throw a pass to the sideline or the end zone and you will see the football player consciously bringing his feet together to stay in bounds. When it comes to deciding on a two-pointer there is a variation of two constantly changing options you will be presented with that are very tempting to try rather than going for the extra point. But here is why I deducted a star. You must go online to play a full real football season. The only option for offline play is ""Play Now"". When you play in that mode wins and losses against the computer are not saved as a scheduled season. It reduces the enjoyment of what could have been a great game for everyone. Why EA? Why did you find it necessary to leave offline players so abandoned?///EPIC!///Everything we have been waiting for all these years & more!///Awesome///Awesome"

The cables work great (might want to get a converter to HDMI as well). The only thing ""wrong"" was big scratches on the top and some minorly loose ports, but that kinda stuff is expected from a 20-year-old Xbox. Games run well and work fine. Don't be expecting great-resolution gaming though. This is 20 years old after all. Check out PC emulators if you prefer high resolution.///Does not read discs///Package arrived early, which was nice, console turned on and worked fine, until it came to reading the discs. The console did not work any further than the home screen, super disappointing. And upon trying to clean the disc scanner, the console was customized so there is no access to this point of the hardware; a part allowing you to go further is missing and replaced with a custom piece that won’t move, meaning if it is broken, its broken.

Thanks again. -- Cyndi Monter///Love my ""retro"" X-Box///I bought this in response to a request for an ""old"" X-Box.  Sure, I have one of these... but I love it, and still use it on occasion.  So I ordered another one to give as a gift.Imagine my delight when I presented this to the person who asked for it, and was told (and I quote):  ""Not that one.  The X-360.""Needless to say, I returned it, and the little ingrate can buy his own console with the $50 gift card he got (and that's only because my wife insisted that I couldn't get him nothing).  I still love the original X-Box and recommend it highly.  Mine has held up for 17 years, and still keeps plugging along.Lesson learned... and I saved myself a chunk of change. (about $160, by my reckoning).  Enjoy the gift card, punk.///Poor quality. Rusted and does not turn on.///I understand this item was not going to be brand new. That said the quality is very poor. Rusted insides not refurbished at all. Does not power on. Oveall disappointed that they would even take someones money and be ok with sending this out.///Great system///My son really wanted this. I was not sure it was going to be good considering it was renewed,  but I was pleased with how well it looked and worked.///Console could not read game discs.///The XBOX console was in good shape externally but would not read my game discs. I took my discs to a local game store and their original XBOX console was able to read all of them.///Overall Pretty great.///The whole thing is great its working smoothly. The only issues were that the controller has a slightly damaged joystick, however it is very minor damage. As well as the internal clock being dead. (This however is common since these things are old and it has no effect on games) Overall its great."

I purchased with the Amazon credit card and did the payment plan which made it a lot easier to afford the big purchase.I don’t really care about Forza, but this console is much faster than the Xbox One in terms of load time and download speed.Do not buy a console with the highest internal storage—-buy the low storage console and get an external drive. I got the seagate 4tb for around $100. They charge WAAAAY too much for the internal storage and you get way more storage capacity with an external drive.For the hours of joy and entertainment this console has provided me, it is worth every penny.///Great System///Love it. Great games, graphics and gameplay///Was nervous about ordering a console for delivery BUT!!!///This was my 1st time ordering a new console online instead of going to a store, and I’m glad I did, OF COURSE I MADE SURE I WAS HOME FOR TO ACCEPT THE PACKAGE, so everything when smoothly and I couldn’t be happier with the purchase, came with everything that was advertised and the console works great. It even made my old Vizio C series 4K look incredible while gaming compared to my ONE X. This New Forza horizon is a great addition to the horizon franchise and of course there’s no reason to not buy this when Rally & Hot Wheels DLC, AND 3 Months of Game Pass ULTIMATE are included. Though now they got me buying a new 3 month subscription code from amazon as its WAY cheaper to buy a code every couple months than pay Microsoft directly (very odd and stupid if you ask me but I’ll save $20+ every 3 months.I will say I bought this bundle during Prime Day so it was at a steep discount at the time.///Love///Was exactly what was promised.  My child has truly enjoyed his game time.///Connect///I have terminal cancer this enables me to connect with my three stepsons through the internet lots of fun .///Game ON///What can I say, if you like to play games you will have at one time or another spent some time on one version of the Xbox or another. This new Series X has great graphics and game play is fantastic.///Finally in stock in some way, shape or form.///I found it kinda annoying that I had to pay $60 more for this for a game I didn’t even want. Box was shipped well, no damage other than the Forza cardboard cover being slightly ripped. Glad it was a new Xbox and not refurbished. The fact I’ve been on a “waiting list” for over a year as an Amazon Prime member for one of these is absolutely mine boggling to me as well. But aside from all of that, the Xbox is absolutely fantastic and a 4K workhorse from the video and games I’ve played so far. It did start to get warm-ish after about 4.5 hours. But nothing I felt the need to be concerned over. My S lasted 6 years and it’s still alive, just sluggish. Let’s see how long the X will go.///Great Device///The Xbox Series X needs to introduction. After many iterations a great protect is created, a 4k gaming machine. Made my Microsoft.The Xbox is small and portable, this one comes with Forza Horizon 5 bundle and everything works as expected. This Xbox only came with one controller as advertised.5/5///Incrível///O console é simplesmente incrível, a função de Quick Resume é ótima e os gráficos impressionam, além do tempo de carregamento praticamente não existir nos jogos e a velocidade de download ser muito superior à geração anterior, se possuir uma TV compatível com o poder do console vale muito a pena!///Great product///The graphics are really good. The X series is a great console"

I'm a big fan of Rick and Morty, so I thought theses would be a nice way to customize My console and controllers. I was disappointed to find that the decals arrived wavy and bent from not being properly packaged for shipping.  I was still able to use all of them, but I find it to be worth noting. The decals are fairly easy to apply, though it does take some patience to get them aligned nicely. The stick well but you're still able to lift them to remove them if needed, without residual residue left behind. Appearance-wise they looks great. The colors are vivid and I would say the product images are accurate. I only wish the one meant for the bottom was the one for the top because I find it to look better. Happy otherwise.///AMAZING QUALITY///Beautiful product. Well Made. Great Quality i am very happy with this product///Skin good, packaging bad///Skin was good and easy to put on only bad part was packaging was bad and it was bent in middle but after heating it up and laying it flat it was fine///Poorly designed///The ones that go in the actual Xbox console worked great. The ones that go on the controller though do not. They don't match the actual holes and they just didn't fit properly nor did it stick well."

This product has been a game-changer (pun intended) for my Xbox gaming experience.Pros:- Long-lasting batteries: The 4800mWh capacity is a significant upgrade from the standard batteries that come with the Xbox controllers.- Convenient charging station: The charging dock is sleek and easy to use, making it simple to keep my controllers charged and ready.- RGB lighting: The colorful lights add a fun touch to my gaming setup.- Compatible with various Xbox controllers: This product works with One, Series X|S, One X|S, and Elite controllers.Cons:- No significant cons, but the price might be a bit steep for some buyers.Overall, I highly recommend the Rysker Charger with Rechargeable Battery Pack to anyone looking to enhance their Xbox gaming experience. It's a great investment for serious gamers!///Fantastic Rysker High Capacity Battery///I'd been thinking about getting new Xbox controller batteries, since I've been gaming much more lately, and came across this set just in time. I've already given everything a good test, and really have no complaints, especially given the reasonable price point.I've had a great experience with the set so far. With a 4800mh capacity, it'll be a welcome change to those currently using smaller batts. such as a 2600mh, which need to be recharged daily for extended sessions. This 4800mh, would also be suitable for online players who don't want to worry about changing batteries mid-session, or someone who regularly uses the rumble feature on the controller.The first thing you'll notice about this set is its thoughtful design. It's sleek build looks attractive on your gaming shelf, or in my opinion, just about any shelf in your home. It's made of a hard plastic material, with a stable quality. It also has rubber feet at the bottom, so that it doesn't slip off surfaces.Due to its two-level design, removing the batteries from this station is quick and easy. The batteries themselves are also solid, and properly shaped for the Xbox X/S controller. The unit also features an on/off switch on the back, and nifty touch controlled multicolor RGB lights. It's great to see a product that pleases in both aesthetics and functionality!If you're still buying AA batteries for your Xbox controllers, this set would be a better option. You'll be saving money in the long run. I was hesitant to use this type of charging product a few years ago, but since trying them, I became a believer of the technology.This one is the best I've tried thus far. All four batteries charged up from empty to full, in less than an hour.  I also got about 30 hours of gameplay from a single battery. I find that very impressive, granted I've tried other charging sets that take much longer to charge, for less battery life.///Charge lasts a lot longer///I purchased these batteries after the last two pair I ordered went dead in less than a year. So far so good! They charge up really fast- and we love the changing colors! Once they are all charged up, you can turn a switch to keep the unit on or off (which is somehow easier for me to remember to turn off- the other ones would end up charging for too long because someone would forget which most likely lead to them dying so fast. Ahem. /so happy that there are 4 of these babies!///Short battery charge///There are a few things I like about this set and one thing I don't. The size of the charger is perfect & doesn't take up much room. I also like the led color lights on the base. The batteries are easy to put into the controllers and easy and quick to charge. The one thing I don't like is that these batteries' charge do not last as long as my previous xbox batteries. Unfortunately, that brand is no longer available. This is why I chose this set. I believe this will work for now but, I will be looking for a better set with longer charge.///Works great!///So much better than buying batteries! Highly recommend for the price! Quality built!///Long lasting/fast charging with great RGB!///These 4800 mWh packs for XBOX controllers have lasted through long gaming sessions over several days and charge lightening fast in the included charger.The charger features 9 beautiful RGB modes that you switch with a tap of the finger and looks great in my gaming setup.I appreciate the chargers overcharge/overheat prevention features which give the confidence to leave the charger on for the additional RGB in my setup.I definitely recommend these battery packs and charger and will likely by another to have more packs on standby for my XBOX controller collection.///This works great!///I love being able to just switch out a charged battery when the low battery notification comes on! With the four batteries included, I'm always ready to play! It takes up less space than a controller charger and is easy to use. Well worth the reasonable price I paid! I would definitely recommend this!///Vraiment au top///J'adore les meilleurs que j'ai achetés sur amazon achetés les sans hésiter.///C'est super !///Pour l'instant c'est super ! Fonctionne très bien. J'espère que le cycle de vie des piles est bonne. Nous verrons après quelques mois d'utilisation.///Great charger!///I had this item for about few weeks now and I absolutely love it. I like how small and compact it is compared to other chargers it doesn’t take up much space on my desk. It takes about 1 hour to fully charge a battery pack and they last about 8-10 hours of gaming and even if it the battery depletes on you, you can easily switch out and put on a fully charged battery since there’s 4 packs in totally which is very convenient to me, I love the clicky noise it makes when you put the battery back on the charger. there’s a display light which shows either it’s fully charged or depleted which is cool and the RGB lights on it makes it look nice with my whole setup. I’ll never need to buy batteries again. Would love if this came in pink!///They're ok///Would like it if I could use it with my OG batteries but there is a cut out on these that make it to where you can't charge any other batteries besides the ones that came with the charger.///Great///Works great"

The buttons are very clicky and occasionally it will miss an input. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase. It's probably a good idea to invest in an actual Xbox controller. Since I am playing fighting games on mine, I will be looking at arcade sticks as well.The 500GB model can fill up pretty quickly when you are installing games so it will limit your library at times.Bonus: when I was checking the system, I pressed the eject button for the disc drive and it actually had a copy of Grand Theft Auto V in the drive!///Great Product///Works great!///So far so good///Seems to work great///does not turn on/work///probably power outlet is broke everything can be plugged in and nothing will turn on wasted my time///Cool item///My kids use this every single day!

If you're looking to level up your gaming setup, look no further than the Xbox Series S. It's pure gaming bliss.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟///Good///It actually was ok not bad everything works perfectly///Incredible value!///Admittedly, I bought this just for Starfield, but I have been playing Fallout 4 (thanks Oppenheimer!), and I can't stop thinking about it. The Xbox Series S is one of the most underrated consoles because, by a landslide, it has the most bang-for-your-buck. I have been playing my Nintendo Switch for the last 3 years, but once I started using this, I have been obsessed!Although the library is not as impressive as that of the Switch or PS5, it has actually been good for me because I am spending more time actually PLAYING games rather than contemplating which games to play on my backlog.I do understand that this is not for everyone. I suppose that if you have already been ""spoiled"" with top-line graphics, this would feel like a downgrade. However, because I bought this for Bethesda games, I could not be happier.Although it might not have the largest library and only slightly inferior graphics than a PS5 (although I don't notice), this console makes up for those shortcomings with it's lean performance. Although it does ""less,"" everything it does is exceptional and meaningful.The only bad thing is that some games did not run properly when I first booted up the console, but after I power-cycled (turn it off for 10 seconds, unplug for 10 seconds, then start it again), everything runs silky smooth.///Happy camper///Bought the gaming system for my nephew. Which I know nothing about lol. All I know is that he wanted an Xbox. Went to the store to purchase a game of his choice to find out this system is digital meaning you can only purchase games online and not the actual disk. Well after a few days of thinking about it, I thought that was the best thing ever! No more lost or scratched games. So now we just go online and purchase all his games and dont have to worry about anything getting scratched or lost. Also, we have access to the gaming store which allows his access to over 100s of kids games that he really enjoys playing. Win win for this aunt!///I love it///I always wanted one for Christmas mommy, thank you so much for buying this present.///Good and affordable///If you want the new gen Xbox’s but can’t get the X, this is for you.///Works amazingly///OMG I was so nervous to buy the refurbished one but, it works so perfectly.///EXCELLENT///Loved this product so much but my husband loved it more for his birthday !///Seems Brand New///I've only had the console for a couple weeks, so I can't comment on how things will go long term, but so far everything seems to be working perfectly well. The box makes it clear that this is a refurbished console, but my experience so far has been like getting a brand new console. From little things like the presentation being well-considered, everything fitting snug in the box, to the fact that there isn't a single ding or scratch or anything on either the console or controller.Can't guarantee your experience will be exactly the same, of course, but, so far, I have zero regrets buying refurbished. As my headline says, it seems brand new.///Works///Fast loading times, good graphics, not much left to be desired. Overall a good budget xbox.///Incredible Purchase!///Although its refurbished, it feels and looks completely brand new. It plays like a dream and has no issues so far. Don't regret this purchase one bit///Do not purchase///Picked the referbished unit for the savings. Worth the price. Came with the full warranty. Controller looks new. Was the price of a used one on the local buy and sells, and has warranty. A no lose situation.Update, controller drift after 40 days. Amazon will not accept return and Microsoft will not warranty. DO NOT PURCHASE****///Super///Mon fils l’adore"

First one system error message , 2nd didn’t even turn in and now the 3rd is overheating horrible company, horrible service. Can’t get ahold of anyone this is absolutely ridiculous. And this is Amazon trusted and rest. Yea right Amazon falling apart just cares about money ever. There deliveries aren’t on time any more. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE///Amazing replacement.///I purchased this to replace my daughters 2014 XBox1.Works great, no problems whatsoever.Would buy this again!///Shipping Issues but Console is Great///Im half American/British and just moved back to the states after 7 years away. I needed a new console so decided to go with the cheaper option and got an Xbox over PS. The Xbox was supposed to come Aug 1st but it didn't show up till Aug 7th. It's not the sellers fault as it was an issue with USPS but still was annoying. As for the console itself, it works great. It came with a power and HDMI cord so was able to quickly set it up. Bought GTA to go with it and it read the disc fine and promptly downloaded the game. Also you get the first month of Game Pass Ultimate for just $1 if you are making an Xbox account for the first time. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for a more cheaper option but want a good working system.///Good console///To be honest I was expecting to have some kind of issue, but I did not. Console came with everything it was supposed to, all items were in good condition. I plugged in, turned on, ran through the initial setup then it started updating for about 30 mins. All in all, I’m pleased with this order.///Don’t buy!///Nothing worked on this Xbox. It came in and I plugged it up same day and no light came on the front and it only made sound. It never showed up on the tv the controller it come with also didnt work. They say it came through a third party company , but Amazon says it went through their department and was checked and serviced and it hadn’t been.///My husband and kid can play again 😂///This Xbox was purchased from Amazon as an Amazon-renewed and it works great 👍; we bought it as a replacement for the Xbox 1 that died after much wear and tear over years of playing with it. 👍 to the Amazon renewal team!!!///Ok///Just came in today and my sons been on it for about an hour, so far the system works fine but the controller doesn't so until I can go get a new one we can't really tell."

I will definitely buy from this company in the future!///Excellent experience///Came in all its original packaging. A+++ experienceFast shipping and a quality product///Constant problem with the refurbished xbox S///I purchased 2 xbox 's  .  One was good and the other was constantly giving me problems.  We had to send the remote control back 1st and in 2 months it did not work (the replacement one).  For the last 5 months I had problems with the xbox freezing up (after receiving the replacement for a totally bad one and now it won't turn on.  I spent good money and am tired of wasting so much time and buying new controllers.///Excellent///Great price everything looked and worked like it was brand new. Thanks alot!///Works As It Should///We had 2 XBoxes in our home- one original XBox One, and one newer like this. After about 10 years, the original quit working.I don't play very often, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a brand new system. After looking a bit, I decided to take a chance.This works just fine, no issues connecting it, setting it up, downloading content, etc.I did remove one star from my review because it came with the wrong power cord. The one it came with didn't fit at all, it was clearly for a different device, so I had to spend an additional $7 for a new cord, and wait for that to be delivered as well. Not the end of the world, just an annoyance.///Good///I like that it was delivered with care and fast. Everything was still sealed and like new///It works perfect///I absolutely have nothing to dislike about it, my son loves it and he is happy to start gaming. He is mostly using it for gaming and fun with his friends.///Did not work///Arrived timely, but would not connect to the wireless remote, and would not stay powered on. Amazon and seller is sending a replacement. Not as timely as we received the first one, guess we will see how the 2nd one does. Will update once we receive and can test. Hoping 2nd time's a charm."

He games about 3 hours a day and these batteries last about a week on a single charge. The pack easily snaps snugly into the charger. It's great to just swap out one battery and insert the next and you're ready to go. They charge up quickly, definitely better than buying batteries or rechargeable AA batteries. Great value for your money. Charging connections are built-in USB, type C, or micro.///New battery///Works good and hold a good charge///Works great///This 4 battery xbox controller charger with 4 2600 batteries is great. The batteries seem to last for days (a day being 24 hours, not a couple of hours a day) of continuous play. (I have put it to the test as a gamer)It is a METAL case and it closes securely. I would be happy to take it in a pocket or bag anywhere. (Except the beach of course. 😉)I am only giving it 4 stars because the clips that the batteries click into (the charging connectors) on this one were a little loose on the batteries. I had to take something small and pull them out a little for them to charge the battery correctly. So far that was only on 2 batteries. The other 2 seem snug enough. I can turn it upside down, open, now, and they will not fall out.It was very slight. But should not have been unecessary. I do not know if it had been sitting somewhere a long time or was manufactured like that, but it is no longer an issue.It charges well, and the 4 lights in the middle indicate which one is charging.It comes with its own charging cable attached AND is designed for it to tuck around the edge.All in all this is a great charger and batteries.If i need more batteries (like if we increased our number of controllers), i will definitely buy another one of these.///Excellent battery life///These batteries have a excellent battery life, very easy to use, my boys are huge gamers and practically live on their Xbox on the weekends, and these batteries last them about 2 to 3 days on a single charge and charge up fast as well, definitely better then buying batteries or the rechargeable AA batteries. Oh and the best part is they have different ways of charging them like 3 different ways I think we just hook up to the back of the Xbox or plug into my phone charger when we are somewhere else but definitely 10 out 10 on this set. Great value for your money.///Great batteries can’t beat the price///I ordered these on a Sunday received them on Monday so very fast delivery they do not need there own battery cover as well there longer lasting than some of the other batteries and they have a great price you can’t beat that plus three ways to charge them you can’t beat that///Great all around quality.///Battery life is great. They most definitely last longer than standard AA batteries do. They fit perfectly as well. I really like the closing case with the charger attached to it, very convenient. It’s almost the exact same size as my iPhone 15 but maybe half an inch thicker. It doesn’t feel cheap, it’s a good product. Nothing bad to say and no regrets from purchasing it.///Working great at 2 months///I recently purchased and Xbox X and knew I would need some rechargeable batteries. I ended up buying this 2 pack and have been impressed with how long they last. I played a few times a week and and have only switched these once or twice. I’ve recommended these to friends and their experiences have been similar.For the price, I find these hard to beat. Definitely go this route and skip buying regular batteries. The payback will be quick going this route for sure.If I could make one complaint, it would be the charging usb is too short. Kind of odd how short the wire is, but I found a good spot in my home. Otherwise, these are great"

This controller has completely elevated my mobile gaming experience to a whole new level!First and foremost, the build quality is top-notch. The controller feels sturdy and well-made, ensuring it can withstand long gaming sessions without any issues. The buttons are responsive and have a satisfying tactile feedback, providing a seamless gaming experience.The ergonomic design of the controller fits comfortably in my hands, allowing for hours of gameplay without any discomfort or strain. The adjustable bracket securely holds my phone in place, ensuring it stays in position even during intense gaming sessions.One of the standout features of the ShanWan Mobile Game Controller is its impressive compatibility with a wide range of games. Whether I'm playing fast-paced shooters or intricate strategy games, this controller adapts seamlessly and enhances my performance.The battery life is also commendable. I was pleasantly surprised at how long it lasts on a single charge, allowing me to enjoy extended gaming sessions without worrying about running out of power.Setting up the controller was a breeze, thanks to the intuitive and user-friendly interface. It connected effortlessly to my phone via Bluetooth, and I was up and running in no time.Overall, the ShanWan Mobile Game Controller has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's a fantastic investment for any mobile gamer looking to take their gaming experience to the next level. I can't recommend it highly enough!///Stunning and Full of App Control Adjustments///𝙽𝚘𝚝𝚎: 𝙼𝚞𝚕𝚝𝚒𝚙𝚕𝚎 𝙿𝚒𝚌𝚜 𝚊𝚛𝚎 𝚒𝚗𝚌𝚕𝚞𝚍𝚎𝚍 𝚝𝚘 𝚐𝚘 𝚊𝚕𝚘𝚗𝚐 𝚠𝚒𝚝𝚑 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚛𝚎𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠.𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰I am a Hard man to please (so my Wife Tells me but she is the Boss). This Phone Q17 gaming Controller surprised me to no end with one caveat. You receive  two cards in package that has bar codes that link to google play for the two apps you will want. One (see Pic) is the home center for all your games and services such as the Xbox game pass, Steam link, games list etc. Its a beautiful and well laid out app. The next and dare I say more important app is the Gamepad Space app. The 2nd card for this link will go to Google Play and inform you that the app is not available. WRONG. It is available in the app store. You will have to manually look it up. Look for the one exactly as I named previously (Gamepad Space) download and install. What you can do with this app is amazing. I only found it recently due to thinking it was removed from the app store but no. Somehow its been moved (possibly by google).I have included a picture so you may also identify it correctly in the play store.𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗱 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽:What you can do with this app is again amazing, You can Test the controller to see if all controls are functional but that's standard. Features that stand out:1:  You can adjust the left and right strength of  motors located in the left/right bottom of controller.2: Create Macro's for you controller so that multiple functions can be achieved with one press. Imagine one button being used for Mortal Combat to do a Fatality. Awesome.3: Adjusting the LT/RT trigger front and rear dead zones.4: Ability to set the Gyro to the left or right Joystick for steering, etc. and the ratio etc.5: Left/Right Joystick can be set to Vertical reverse, Horizontally reverse, convert to directional keys, convert directional keys to left joystick, Swap left and right Joysticks (helpful for left handers too.)6: Firmware update access and device information.𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲Does not feel cheep. Its feels of good quality. Feels good in hand and all controls are easily accessible with your fingers.𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬The ability to adjust the joystick height is such a great Feature. The extensive features of both apps are fantastic. I have had it the pass 30 days and seems very durable. Fantastic that I do not have to remove the phone case and you can press down in the controller cradle to adjust for thickness. An additional pro is that a bonus USB and Lightning L angled extension comes free as a bonus. Its very high quality. Nice touch in that it does not have pass thru charging due to Bluetooth. You can have phone plugged into charger while using the case. Also you get as a bonus these cite paw print joystick covers and a high quality braided USB cord.𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬The controller shows up as an wireless controller on the phone when connected thru Bluetooth but a retro-gaming app I use identifies it as an PlayStation 4 controller. There is no way to change its affiliation to Xbox controller though with all the apps I have used with this it does not appear to be an issue.𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧Well made, Fantastic Controller Apps, Bonus attachments. This is a highly recommended and customizable controller you will appreciate and enjoy gaming with.𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞I did not receive this controller The ShanWan Q17 either as a gift or a free product for review. I only reviewed this because I am very happy with the purchase of this product and found it very much worth my time to submit.///Works well, great battery life, comfort and fits my case.///I was hesitant because of the potential lag that bluetooth might introduce but im very happy with this purchase.  The battery last long and it fits my iphone 15 pro max with its case.  I have used it with my spegin case and a lifeproof case.  The comfort is very good and it has a button that is mapped to the PS5 touch pad which is a nice perk for anyone who uses PS Remote like i do.  I would recommend this case.  I wish it would collapse a bit when not in use like the game vice but thats a small complaint.///Broke in 2 Weeks!///Honestly, I liked it at first. For the price, it felt great, and there were no connection issues initially. The controller worked smoothly, and I was happy with how it performed. However, after just two weeks, it started malfunctioning. Now, whenever I expand it to fit my phone, the Bluetooth shuts down, and the right side of the controller doesn’t work at all.As you can see in the picture, the light on the right side is completely off, showing that the controller isn’t functioning properly.I was pretty satisfied when I first got it, but I guess this is what I get for not going with a name-brand option. Giant bummer."

That's why I was excited to try out the Charger for Rechargeable Xbox One Controller Battery Pack with 4x5520mWh Batteries. After putting it through its paces, here's my take on its performance.First and foremost, let's talk about convenience. This charger is a game-changer for anyone tired of constantly swapping out disposable batteries or dealing with the hassle of charging individual battery packs. With the capacity to charge four batteries simultaneously, it ensures that you always have a fully charged backup ready to go, so you can stay immersed in your gaming experience without interruption.The included 5520mWh batteries pack a serious punch in terms of power and longevity. With a single charge lasting upwards of 15 hours of gameplay, you can say goodbye to frequent battery changes and hello to extended gaming sessions. Plus, with four batteries included in the pack, you have more than enough power to keep you going for marathon gaming sessions or multiplayer battles with friends.One of the standout features of this charger is its intelligent design. The LED indicators provide real-time feedback on the charging status of each battery, so you always know when they're ready to go. Plus, the compact size and sleek design make it a seamless addition to any gaming setup, whether you're playing at home or on the go.In terms of durability, these batteries are built to last. With a high-quality construction and reliable performance, they're designed to withstand the rigors of intense gaming sessions without losing power or efficiency. Plus, with built-in protection against overcharging and short circuits, you can charge your batteries with peace of mind, knowing that they're in good hands.Overall, the Charger for Rechargeable Xbox One Controller Battery Pack with 4x5520mWh Batteries is a must-have accessory for any Xbox gamer looking to level up their gaming experience. With its convenient charging capabilities, long-lasting power, and intelligent design, it's a small investment that pays off big in terms of convenience and performance. Highly recommended for gamers of all levels!///Works great and easily charges!///I Like the fact that you can charge 4 batteries at once and you can tell when they are at 100% Batteries are also long lasting in my controllers. Easy to tell which way you install them as well! Love that I can use the front usb charging port on my xbox one so I know exactly where it is!///Works Surprisingly well!///These batteries have worked amazing in mine and my roommates controllers, but be aware they have to be plugged into the dock to charge properly. They will not charge with the controller plugged in. All in all would buy another set.///Worth the money///These work well in my controllers.  The difficulty is with how they charge and the length of the cable on the charger.  Cable is pretty short so hard to plug in.  Batteries seem to fit in charger in all directions so it's not clear how you are supposed to put them in to charge.  Also charge longevity only seems about the same as the 1550 batteries that I have from another brand.///Its an XBOX must have///I hated running out of batteries while I was playing, and finding new batteries in the house was a pain most of the time. This set of four batteries and the charger are great. I love the green and red LEDs to indicate charging status. It's a compact setup, and the batteries last quite a while. The only drawback is that the charging cord is fixed to the battery holder, and it's on the short side. Either they need to make it a detachable cable or give you a longer one. I am glad it does not come with a wall wart power source, as those are a pain, and they always cover two outlets. If the cord were longer or replaceable, this would be perfect, but it's still the one to have if you have controllers to feed.///Works great///Been using these batteries since Christmas with 2 kids that play a LOT of Xbox games. Batteries last a long time and recharge just fine. They usually last 3-4 hours with kids using gaming headsets with mics plugged into the controller.They do take a while to recharge completely (4-5 hours) because I have the base plugged into a USB 3 port on the Xbox (which is only 4.5W). I also tried using the USB-C port on the base with a true 20W USB-C charger and it made just a little difference in recharge time (maybe 3-4 hours).Very satisfied with this product.///Sick of batteries?///I liked this. Better than finding double a batteries my kid keeps losing and trying to keep them charged. They last awhile for me and fit in my Xbox controller nicely. They are easy to install as long as you out them in right the charger works well and I love it has the colors to show me when they are charging. I love you can tuck the usb cord away. The price is worth the batteries. I gamed for 3 days about 8 hours each without having to charge them again.///Fast charging///Easy to setup and use.  Charges up to 4 battery packs for the Series X. Battery swaps are simple.  Just pay attention to how it’s supposed to fit or you’ll bend some things you don’t want to bend in your controller."

Great job and less pricey than a new unit and it shipped very quickly too///You get exactly what you pay for///Foremost the Xbox condition stated excellent and it looks brand new and performance is perfect and on cue. I couldn’t be more pleased for the quality for the price.///Arrived Broken///This has made me never want to trust refurbished items on amazon. I knew it was a renewed console, but I thought that it was only sold if it worked. The second I logged in, it stopped working completely. It also had stretched resolution, and played static sounds for the first 15 minutes it was plugged in. It also weirdly has smelled like a campfire, from the second I took it out of the box.///Really great quality///It works as well as any new Xbox I’ve ever bought and it arrived early too! So that was cool lol///Product is in Perfect Working Condition///Although UPS dropped my package in the next door mailbox when I finally got it I couldn't get of it!  Amazon did a great job but UPS tried to cramp my style.///Faulty at arrival May change if seller responds (UPDATE)///UPDATE:So the seller contacted me to try to work on a resolution.  I had decided just before to get a refund so I could get one more quickly.  I changed me review from a 1 to a 4 because other than the HDMI port issue being faulty at arrival, the condition was good, they sent a controller with, and it was packaged well.  Again, they did reach out to try to help find a resolution but I decided it couldn’t wait otherwise I would have worked with them.Got this as a gift to my kids and after revealing this to them, I tried to boot it up and the TV wouldn’t register it.  I tried multiple HDMI cables and different TVs that have working IoT devices on them currently but this console wouldn’t work.  So at minimum, the HDMI port is faulty.  I have contacted the seller and depending on their response I will alter my review.///Good///Good product. My son loves it. Had one before although and after 3 months it stopped working out of nowhere. We bought this one which every week seems like the price was increasing!  Still have it and it's been almost a year .///Missing stuff///So when this arrived it was not the all digital one it did not have an HDMI cable with it and the controller doesn’t look like a licensed Xbox controller. other than that everything seems good"

We do game quite a bit, some days for hours on time, some days for just an hour. They hold a great amount of battery life. There is 4 of them so you will always have a good battery charged. I just plug the charging device into our Xbox and forget about it. We change them out when need be! Overall great item we have bought.///Great buy///Great looking charger, charges quickly, batteries last a pretty good time between charges.  It is a little tricky figuring out how to get the batteries in the first time but I promise you if they don't pop in easily they aren't turned the right way///Absolutely excellent!!!///This us the perfect set up for serious xbox controller gamers. The individual batteries last for multiple hour sessions over multiple days.The charging dock is excellent as well! I have absolutely nithing bad to say about this product. As a matter of fact I would rate it 10 stars if I could. You will not be dissappointed with this purchase, I assure you 👍😎///Handy, but short battery life///They are easy to charge, the stand works well and is easy to keep out of the way. Very easy to swap out and fit the controller well. But the life between charges is very low. I have 2 controllers, one using these and one using Amazon Basics alkaline batteries. The basics have lasted through 3 of these so far. So make sure to get the 4 pack.///Great battery life, easy to use///This rechargeable battery pack is easy to use and a must have for any gamer. The stand has a on/off function that can continuously charge the battery pack or you can turn off when you get a freshly charged pack. The batteries loose some battery life when not being charged but quickly recharge once turned back on. I've been using these since I got them and have had zero issues. Great item, great price and well worth it.///Nice quality///Works good for my controllers///Good quality///In my case, the battery life could be better ( 1 week or 2 in my case) but its no problem for me cause it has 4 batteries and I have 2 controllers.Good quality, looks good, works good for the price///Nice///Looking for something better than what I had and this hit it out of the park. Perfect for what I needed. Fits perfectly for all my controllers and looks nice///Works great saves money on batteries.///I was spending lots of money on batteries for me and my son. This product saved me a pile of money already. I will update my review if I have any future problems.///Erfüllt seinen Zweck///Macht was es soll. Akkus haben eine lange Laufzeit///Reliability///I tried other rechargeable batteries products and to be honest this one meets all my needs.  You need to check if this is compatible with your XBox controller as they are slightly different and this product may not be suitable.  I always check the reviews read the specifications to ensure you’re not disappointed.  Find it easy to slide the battery in the controller bit fiddly at first but soon got the hand of it."

Side-note (not factored into the score), the BRAND NEW unit sold by Amazon (not a 3rd party) turned out to be used.  The box seal had been opened, and even the screen protector was gone.  So I returned it and got another.  Second side-note, the first unit came with the wall charger, but the replacement did not (even though it is pictured in the manual).  I thought this was a mistake, but then found a slapped-on statement from Logitech saying they stopped including wall adapters for the good of the environment (yeah that gets a huge LOL, congrats on your cost-savings Logitech).  On to the real review ...I wanted the unit mostly to be able to stream games from my PS4 (in my living room) and Xbox Series X (upstairs in a racing / flying cab).  And long story short - this unit FINALLY delivers what I have been striving for since I tried using the PSP to connect to my PS3 many years ago (and then Vita, which was equally bad at streaming).  The Xbox streaming works great with the Xbox app.  The controllers work amazingly well.  The PS4 at first worked good enough to play, but the resolution varied and sometimes would get a little blocky.  I connected it to my router using a network cable, and that made the streaming become crystal clear.  Works great anywhere in my house.  To stream anywhere in the world requires port forwarding to be setup on the router, and so I am not going to pursue that.  Note that I am using a 3rd party app for the PS4 streaming so the Logitech controls are fully supported.  I will say I can detect a slight lag in the controls (probably less than a tenth of a second), which for a high-speed game (think racing) the experience is still playable but is slightly impacted.  But for my usage (Fallout 4 on PS4, Flight Simulator on Xbox) gameplay feels just fine and a very slight delay does not impact gaming.I am also using the unit as a retro-gaming handheld.  Gaming is fantastic for all consoles that are GameCube and earlier.  PS2 works great for some titles, but has some slowdown for others (but settings can be tweaked to be playable for just about anything).  For me, having a giant library of Advance titles, SNES, Genesis, and yeah even Atari is awesome.The ergonomics of the G Cloud is fantastic.  I have fairly large hands, and it is comfortable to play.  The screen at 7 inches doesn't sound big, but compared to my Switch Lite and older PS handhelds, the screen is a magical giant gift from the gods.  Resolution is a very sharp 1080P.  Touch works great, and so the hardware is quite impressive.  Battery life is outstanding.So the memory at 64GB is one weak point of the system.  There IS a microSD expansion, and I had to spend a couple of days to get everything working well.  Bottom line, I first tried a 512GB Sandisk card, and it did not work correctly, despite trying every formatting method out there.  Folks, 256GB is the max, trust me.  So a Sandisk 256GB works like a charm.  It will NOT work correctly if you extend the storage as part of the Android device.  It has to be formatted as external storage, and then it works great.The beauty of this device is that it is truly just an Android device with Google Play.  So the gaming options are almost unlimited.  And you can use it to watch movies, or control your thermostats, or whatever you use a normal Android device for.In summary, this is an amazing device and I could not be happier with it!///Perfect for what it is designed to do.. stream games from your local consoles.///All these reviews about this device being underpowered for emulating are really missing the point of this device. This is really a switch like controller that runs android so it can run remote play apps or cloud gaming apps (though much more comfortable to hold then a switch with better battery life.) if you want a device that can do emulation and full console gaming but portable you will definitely want to look elsewhere for something like a price subsidized steam deck, or Retroid device or any of the other smaller emulation designed devices would better suite you.I however was looking for a high quality, portable sturdy second screen with good controls  and good battery life which 12 hours is hard to beat. (Yes you can do with with an iphone / ipad or android phone / tablet but if you have tried that like i have you will find the screen size to be too small with thick black bars to make a 16:9 aspect ratio that is standard with TVs or for the case of tablets too large and now sitting on a table bluetoothed to a controller.) This device out of the box (at least for xbox, playstation requires a 3rd party app called PSPlay as the Sony official app doesn’t support the g clouds controllers yet (maybe with an update to Sony's app))  will take your console and make it portable just be sure to have wifi 5 (which is the wifi spec on the g cloud) or greater as this all requires a lot of local bandwidth on your personal wifi network.I found for the best results i had to hard wire my consoles over LAN and then to use my eero wifi 6 system as the final wireless step to the g cloud, i have had almost no artifacting, latency issues, or  ghosting since switching to this setup notice i didnt say none.. just 99% perfect streaming. Even with other traffic on my network like my partner streaming movies over apple tv etc. this setup performs almost perfectly enough to think its happening on device.I did initially try to use the PS4 pro and Xbox S on wifi, and while the xbox s’ modern wifi worked great, the ps4 pro’s was not good, downloading or updating software while trying to remote control the console would resort in artifacts and issues. I mostly blame Sony’s` wifi in the ps4 pro as even when it was connected to the tv i had issues with it.  The minute i put it on LAN all those issues went away and it was as if the G cloud was directly connected to the PS4 Pro i was able to crank up PSPlay’s streaming settings to max and the gaming became buttery smooth. Microsofts Xbox App does a lot of the work for you when it comes to remote play and is frankly superior to sony’s app and even the 3rd party PSPlay (which is an improvement on the official Sony one.) The xbox app  will automatically scale the graphics quality based on current wifi and other factors to smooth out the experience so, while not unusable as the ps4 pro was over wifi, it was just not a perfect experience but still playable! But, again for best results hardwire LAN to the xbox s and then wifi 6 to the g cloud for buttery smooth, full hd, no artifacting or noticeable lag while gaming.I did try some Xbox Cloud Gaming but found that to be sorta redundant as I have a console in my home but i guess the option is nice if you don't.. however the streaming was only ok in my opinion. I have fios fiberoptic gigabit internet with wifi 6 and i still had artifacting and some lag, while playable for non timing critical games definitely not a perfect or optimized experience. It just seems at this time that game streaming from servers outside the home is just not ready for prime time in my opinion.I think playing my consoles on g cloud is going to replace playing my consoles on my tv as I prefer the handheld form-factor and casualness of just picking up and playing like the switch but the graphics of the better consoles really pop on the 7” screen which is really the star of the show. The screen really is good for a LCD, the black levels are good, colors pop and it gets very bright! Hard to find something like this with this battery life.The android version on the device is basic but the addition of tablet mode means you can multitask (something you cant do in the “console ui”) The device software in its current revision lacks screen mapping of the controls so android games will run but wont take advantage of the extra hardware buttons and sticks (this is something that can be added with 3rd party software but as I only use this as a console portable screen I have not tried this, as all the software I use is designed for the controls or has control mapping) this is apparently  not good if you want to run games natively on the device but with its specs it wont really do a good job at that.This device really has been narrowly designed for streaming games and its processor does an amazing job at that for 12 hours but your milage playing game software locally will vary (not that i have tried just seen other reviewers attempts.)"

Straight out the box and after updating. How do they even release this product with such issues///Very good sound for the price///Build feels solid, mic sounds pretty good, it's quite comfy(a little discomfort on the top of the head but I'm sure it's just getting used too and breaking it in), and I'm blown away by the sound. It's a little bass heavy but you can tune it in the settings. Seriously though these sound better than my $150 Sennheiser's that aren't gaming headphones. Really impressed. Great soundstage and it really feels like a home theater on the ears.Will say I had an issue with the mic not working in game even though I could hear it on the monitor but it seems to be fixed after talking with support and doing a power refresh cycle where I took the account off, powered down and unplugged everything from the Xbox, waited 2 minutes, started it up and added back the account but made sure not to import the old settings when prompted. The service guy said that something may have become corrupted. It seems too be working now! Will keep you posted!///It doesn’t work///I get sound from my phone through the headset but absolutely none from my Xbox which is like the one thing that should work.///Audio delay///I love the clean design, comfort, and native Xbox integration. The controls are well integrated with large dials that are easy to interact precisely with, as opposed to the small fiddly controls on other headsets.Audio quality out of the box is disappointing. Similar to the original Xbox Wireless Headset, very heavy on the low end making for a muddy/muffled sound. I imagine this can be somewhat corrected using EQ settings, but a headset should sound good and balanced out of the box. The nail in the coffin is that the audio latency, just like the original, is still worst in class. It is especially noticeable in a shooter like COD where you pull the trigger, see the weapon fire on screen...and then you hear the gunshot a beat later. It's immersion breaking and actually puts you at a disadvantage in competitive games that rely on audio cues, as well as rhythm games.///Good headset…eventually///I had to return the first one I received after talking with Microsoft support for hours because the headset would not receive any sound from the console. The second one worked much better and I’m very happy with it. Very good sound and the ability to mess with the equalizer for fine tuning. Easy to mute the mic and also has very convenient knobs for volume control and game/chat audio tuning.///Connects but no sound///I was able to pair the headset with my iPhone and it worked but no audio when connected to the Xbox. I contacted support and we were unable to get it set up. The audio didn’t sound great when connected with my iPhone either.///Great sound, great comfort, poor build quality///This headset is absolutely perfect in every facet except for one. This headset has great sound quality, great comfort, and it’s very easy to use and setup. Unfortunately, about 3 months after my purchase, the plastic part of the headband closest to the earmuff broke away from the earpiece. the headset is still usable and still fairly comfortable. If you want a good wireless headset for a fairly good deal, pick these up. Just be sure to be gentle with them///Save your money///Recently bought one via the Microsoft app and when I finally got it was broken. No audio was playing and kept disconnecting from my series x.///Cut in and out when the audio gets busy///I loved my old Microsoft wireless headset but as the years went by it did start to cut out and create distortion sounds when the gameplay got busy. I was super excited to see this updated version and decided to give it a go. This headset is doing the exact same thing as my old one except there are no distortion sounds. It does cut in and out a lot when the gameplay gets busy. I have tried it with Diablo 4, rust, and dayz and it's fine mostly for those games but one I started to play black ops I couldn't even hear what was going on in the game because it's cutting in and out so much. I had to return it as much as it pains me. I will be purchasing the steel series as my husband never has any issues with his."

It's been a great addition to my setup, and I highly recommend it to fellow Xbox gamers.///It WORKS!///I got this for my boyfriend so we could download more games on his Xbox X/S or whatever it’s called (I really don’t know). He literally plugged it in, went to the settings and added it as an item I suppose and immediacy it took it and said he gained the storage! I will say it’s not 1 full TB, it was like 966 or something of that range but that’s basically a terabyte no? Regardless it worked, he was able to download all his favorite games and the games we wanted to play together even though I’m not the biggest fan of playing (just watching lol). So yes! It works, it’s awesome and he was super duper happy about it.Im unsure of the price of what this should be on other sites or brands but I felt that this was worth it! He gets to download literally everything he wants with more to spare, it was super easy, convenient, and since he downloaded all the games onto the SD card itself (you can choose) if I’m right, he can take it out and bring it elsewhere and keep all his data. So points for compatibility and portability. The design is super sleek, literally can’t see it, and the quality is outstanding!///Fast drive with plenty of space.///I purchased this drive for my Xbox and I am beyond happy with it. It allows me to install and run my games from this drive and they worked perfectly while running from this.///Review///Great product, real storage 920 GB which is real good, fully compatible, overall happy with the purchase.///Pretty useful, but pricey///Got it on sale during prime day, still a bit over $100. I wish you could add your own like on PS5, but this is still really good, just a bit expensive. Performance is on par with internal storage.///Works excellent///Great product.Easy to use.It can be formatted for multiple consoles.Really plug and play///Great storage expansion card, but not a full TB///Works as advertised and works great playing X/S series games from in but you only get 920GB of storage and 919.9GB after you format the storage. I know it’s only 80GB probably used for whatever makes it works but you pay for 1TB? You should have the whole 1TB to use.  WD storage card is great, and I would buy it again. I wish WD made a 2TB or bigger storage card.///Works just fine///Does what it's meant to do, at a better price than the only other option from Seagate.///Ótimo produto///Produto veio bem embalado e sem danos. Funciona 100% no Xbox series S///Ótima qualidade///Mesmo sendo muito caro ainda , ainda sim é uma ótima alternativa para expandir a memória do Xbox , pode comprar sem medo , fácil de usar , sem erro .///Fonctionne très bien !///Mis en place sur la Xbox série X !Fonctionne très bien !

Too bad they gave me a bonk product, honestly bummed.///Amazing///Great Seller, item better than description, glad to have purchased item from this seller, would highly recommend Seller///Great for the price///I bought this headset 3 years ago on a super small budget and after 3 years it just started to break it started peeling a while ago but for the price this headset is really good and worth it///Honest opinion///Honestly I have pretty much nothing bad to say about these. The sound is good not great but still passes for me. Obviously you will not compare it to a turtle beach or whatever. The fit is great for me and lightweight. I played for 3 straight hours and didnt bother me much at all. The fabric on the cord is really nice and durable and its straight plug in play 3.5 mmj. the only bad is the mute switch. It did not work on having to mute it. That is it! Doesnt bother me at all because I'm not into chatting or whatever. I gave it a 4 stars for it. Almost perfect but you get what you buy. I have had it for almost a month not and works as it should. I definitely recommend if you are a beginner or want a budget headset.///Great headphones for kids and adults///Theya re Greta headphone with great sound quality. They are adjustable on each side to make smaller or bigger. The mic works very well and you can turn it on or off. The cord is a good size length no matter what they are using it for. I would highly recommend these headphones!///Broke pretty quickly///The first day I got the headset, everything worked great. By the second day, the right ear piece volume started cutting in and out, especially if the cord was moved any. Then by the 4th day the right ear piece was completely dead and only sound in the left ear and the mic (which would occasionally cut out from time to time) and now not even a fully week later with the headset and the left ear piece is cutting out and back on like the right side was doing so I assume a matter of time before it's completely useless and broken and I always take great care of my gaming equipment.///Doesn't last and VERY UNCOMFORTABLE///The headphones are cute and functional in the short term, but there are some issues. The headphones consistently hurt my ears after about an hour of use. Stuffing cotton in the ear area has helped, but they're still uncomfortable to wear and painful after a few hours. After about six months of use, the microphone began cutting out, and after ten months, the microphone is basically unusable. After eleven months, there is a loud static in the right ear that won't go away. They were okay for a while, but I would strongly suggest investing in better headphones for your own sanity.///Perfect for school///It’s working fabulous for my grandson in Kindergarten!!!!  Better than I could imagine!!!///Loved it///Thank u///جميلة جدا///لون جميل واداء جميل شكرا///Good for the money///My grandson love them///It works!///I liked that the mic worked and when you take a video other sounds from around still appear so the noice cancellation is not really that good.///Headphones work, not microphone///Bought 3None of the microphones work on the xbox one."

The item arrived packaged well and semi-assembled. There was red dust all over the stand when I unwrapped it that needed to be cleaned off. It was also pretty scratched up and while the right side was assembled, the left side was dangling with the bolts half in place, like they never finished assembly. Once cleaned up and put together, it works well and is solid. I have never seen the GT OMEGA Classic in person to compare to it, but it seems to be a decent alternative for the price. Paid $83 at the time, and would feel more comfortable with it if it was closer to $70.///Solid stand///Unbelievable value for money. I thought there’d be a lot of play(flex/movement) in this wheel stand it’s pretty solid. I bought this for my nephew I have a next level racing wheel stand that 100% solid that cost about £200 I paid about £80 for this an it’s 90/95% solid.. wish I’d bought this first.. fact///Better than expected///This Wheel and Pedal Base/Rig is very easy to build. Instructions are clear and simple. What suprised me was the allover build and material quality for the price tag. This was the 2nd or 3rd rig I tried and all the others were more expensive and had lower quality. Its mostly Aluminium but with the Wheel and Pedals mounted its quite heavy which is great for high ForceFeedback settings.Allover a great product. Would recommend it for everybody that plays Racing Sims from the Sofa or don't have much space for a full sice Racing Rig.Im not giving 5/5 stars because nothing is perfect///Great product works well///Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Easy to assemble and easy to use.///スタンドタイプ探してる方にはオススメ///スタンドタイプは価格も作りも様々で迷ってしまうところですが、価格と強度これに的を絞り選びました。組み立てについてほぼ、完成系になっているので組立て苦手な方も手を出しやすいかと思います。説明書ざっくりとした説明なので、どのボルトを使えばいいのか判断しにくいと思います。部材関係必要なものが一式そろってます。シフター増設する時も、取付ボルトをあらためて準備する必要はないです。強度材質もしっかりしており、開封時キズや錆もありません。実際、GT7をプレイしても強度不足で集中できないということもありませんでした。重量しっかりしている分、重量はあります。ハンコン、シフターまで取り付けると、当然ですが更に重くなります。下部のボルト穴を使ってキャスターにして、部屋の片隅に片付けるようにしました。総評値段と作りからしたら大満足。オススメできます。"
"Microsoft Xbox One X 1TB, 4K Ultra HD Gaming Console, Black (Renewed) (2017 Model)",US$275.00,4.2,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Microsoft-Xbox-One-Gaming-Console-Renewed/dp/B07CSLG8ST/ref=sr_1_46?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xkm0kH5DkRAHwvFY7ZBCe3Pu4Qobte2p4nQVdb93cw1Mdmwjjo1Sh52pG0VitNm8leA_PVvlIwvKDQ4qiY10mv5YuXwBMW6KfasfZyEMMM2QCAliiveN9CrHXbEZHMNTP1kjmF2IdCYbEMgWWxbYBplmcBYWSJEXEMsKIlhDC0-9yKj-eMXkZZ_WLXNjyzdGYOsEswvr1ilqoB5dw5ny9rmAicqF-g6c0MyeAp3nUXk.0WkInoihowCI06tmQsEhzU6T-ej_AXmBS6Yu747KX4w&dib_tag=se&keywords=xbox&qid=1731040845&sr=8-46,"A Very Satisfying Purchasing Experience///The seller answered my one question about the Xbox promptly, shipping was quick, the console shows no signs of wear and works perfectly so far 🙂 The controller is obviously not original to the console, as the controller is lime green and console is black, but that's a minor quibble, as it works well and is something of a conversation starter. After reading horror stories online about refurbished gaming consoles, I'm happy to report that, for the price and good condition, this was a pretty great deal. Seller even included batteries for the controller.///Works like new!///I was hesitant on buying this refurbished Xbox One X console because of the horror stories I have heard about renewed ones. I took a chance on this one and it has turned out to be great! The console was very clean and had no visible marks or scratches on it. Although the controller did have a scratch on it but it did not interfere with game play. It did not come with the original retail box but did have the necessary accessories to hook it up. I was surprised that it turned out to be a great buy after all. Overall the system looks great basically new and I have not had any issues with it. I am happy with the chance I took on purchasing it and happy with the results that it has worked flawlessly for me.///Works great!///After seeing many mixed reviews I was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished Xbox. In the end I decided to go through with it. My main concern with it being refurbished was that many consoles didn’t work or turned on just fine the first time but the following time it stopped working.  I’ve had mine for about a week now and it’s been working very well. Coming from a first generation Xbox One to the One X is quiet outstanding. I play on a 1080 TV and the quality of the picture is outstanding, it’s more clear and smooth. One down side is the price. You could get a brand new Xbox  X for that price. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak it’s a little hard to find brand new, since many places are out of stock.///Unreliable game system///I played the console about two weeks then it stop working. Not worth buying refurbished.///Console worked had a few scratches nothing bad///Controller that  came with the console had  insane stick driftEdit: the controller I think updated and now works fine I apologize for my incompetence///What a great buy///The price was amazing, arrived super fast, and the thing is like brand new. You wouldn’t even know its refurbished.///Working great so far. Happy it came on time///There was a week delivery window (Monday through Friday) & to my surprise it came on the first day! Came via UPS in a box. Renewed Xbox One X 1 TB console came in original Xbox One X box sealed with one controller, Xbox game pass, & Xbox live codes, power cord, manuals, batteries for wireless black controller, HDMI cable. Everything was neat in plastic just like new. Console powered up just fine, updated & is working just fine.  You probably won't be able to fit your entire gaming library on the 1 TB drive.. I've installed 6 games & about half of it has been used. Map & other DLC take up space too. No charge cord for the controller since it came with regular batteries. I've ordered a charge base that comes with two charge packs. I'll update if needed///Great experience///My package showed up earlier than expected, and was obviously packed with care. The unit was in 2 layers of bubble wrap,  plus even boxed and sealed twice. It has been working perfectly. Highly recommended.///The service was good but I was able to get a product closer here so that’s why it was returned///I was able to get one closer to home that’s why I sent it back///stop working after 4 hours is a fraud///reicive the xbox no controller no hdmi cable i plug my personal 4k hdmi cable at this point all is good after 4 hours the screen start glitching and sudenly my screen turn black i try change the HDMI cable and thats not resolving the problem the screen stay totaly black !!!! dont buy that's scrap is just a pure fraud i dont understand why amazon dont shut down this seller account///Code derreur///Article en parfait état  mais peu pas jouer avec , quand elle shut down pas tout seul c'est TOUT et littéralement TOUT les jeux sans exception qui ne demare pas ...chaque fois ya code d'erreur de corruption du disque dur... payé 600$ pour une console qui fonctionne même pas c'est vraiment frustrant"

It’s easy to install and works immediately. Fan is really quiet as well. It has different LED color options and includes two USB ports for charging controllers or whatever else. Looks really slick and matches well!///Works well///Very stylish as well as effective fan. Worth the money to invest for your series x. Even quit when on high. Recommend it highly.///Does the Job Pretty Well!///This device keeps my Xbox Series X nice and cool, exactly as I need. The LED color change function is great for matching the color changing motifs of what lives on my desk. The three fan speed settings are great for anticipating heavy gaming sessions with Triple-A games in addition to keeping the console breezy for casual play. The fan is a little loud, and as someone who works in data centers and server rooms, that's hardly a problem for me personally, though it may matter to you. Easy to install, took but a few seconds. The included dust grates are ""okay"" - they leave a little too much residue on the console's plastic case if they're removed, so I've elected not to use them, which is fine, as I mostly wanted the fan and top dust cover. I can always find another product to suit my needs there. The top dust cover is removable, though I would recommend leaving it on unless cleaning the fan. The silicone dust covers are great for keeping dust and detritus out of unused ports on the front and back of the console. They were a little hard to pop out and remove from the silicone sheet they came in, but once they're out, it's hardly an issue. None of them tore while removing them, though I could see them tearing if the wrong amount of force is applied in the wrong place - be careful! Otherwise, great buy, highly recommended.///Got to keep the xbox cool.///Works pretty good, lights up the room too. Sounds like a fan blowing. I leave it running all the time.///Perfect///Doesn't let dust inside and makes it more cooler, is a perfect product! Love it, is easy to clean the dust and the led lights are cool tho I not use them so much.///Awesome!///Besides the fact you have to manually turn it off, it still genius product! I love the fan power and the multiple colors you can choose! And it gives me assurance that I don't have to worry about dust and stuff damaging my XBOX. It also adds a little elegant look to the console. Both thumbs up for this product!!!///No Off Switch///I really like the concept of this device.  It's sleek looking, and it functions as advertised (in terms of cooling my Xbox Series X).  However, there are a couple of downsides which (hopefully) will be addressed by the manufacturer in the future.  1) There is no on/off switch.  It's powered by plugging the USB cable into the Xbox port.  The problem is that the fan remains on even when you turn off the Xbox.  I often play while in bed and when it's time to go to sleep, and I'm already under the covers, I simply turn off my system remotely and go to sleep.  But now I have to get up out of bed and manually remove the USB cable from the system.  Not good!  2) The fan unit doesn't have a memory.  I like the light bar on the unit and like to change the color to solid red.  I also like to set the fan to high.  However, when you plug the unit back in, it defaults to the factory setting and I have to re-adjust everything.  Not the end of the world but still a nuisance.Fix these issues and there is a 5-star rating just waiting in the wings.///Easy installation and cooling///Works great and lights look cool. Little loud at top speed but can’t hear when gaming with headphones. Just have to take dust cover off top before running fan or plastic gets very hot.///Cool Addition///This item is a cool addition for the Series X. Looks great and functions well. The price is probably more than it should be but if it preserves the life of ones console then worth it in the long run.///Ventilateur avec Lumière Colorée LED pour Xbox Séries X,///Ce ventilateur avec lumière LED pour Xbox Series X est un excellent ajout pour tout gamer cherchant à améliorer le refroidissement de sa console. Tout d'abord, le système de ventilation est très efficace pour garder la console au frais, même pendant les sessions de jeu prolongées. Le faible bruit du ventilateur est un gros plus, il est quasiment inaudible, ce qui permet de se concentrer pleinement sur le jeu. Les lumières LED colorées ajoutent une touche esthétique sympa, surtout dans une configuration gaming. Le filtre anti-poussière est une excellente idée pour protéger la console sur le long terme. En plus, les bouchons de protection en caoutchouc sont un bon bonus pour garder les ports bien propres. Avec 2 ports USB supplémentaires,///Excellent!///Fantastic cooling fan and I highly recommend it.A must-have to keep your console dust-free and cool.Great price and value for money.I've been using it for the past few days and it keeps my console really cool ,even when running beefy games like Baldurs Gate 3 for a few hours.My console would get hot when playing this game, now with the fan on high setting ,it only gets slightly warm.The fan fits perfectly and it easy to slot on.The dust protection cover, vent stickers are great, stick on really well and are easy to apply.The rubber stoppers for USB,game disc etc are really good ,but a bit awkward to cut out.The fan settings go from low to high,and the light settings are easy to change.The only downside is thatthe fan is quite loud,especially on the 3rd higher setting.///Perfekte Belüftung !!!///Der Lüfter erfüllt total seinen Zweck er kühlt das Gerät perfekt runter. Die zusätzlich mitgelieferten gummi-abdeckungen erfüllen ebenfalls ihren Zweck indem sie Öffnungen die nicht benötigt werden abdecken, auch die Lüftergitter die man leicht auf das Gehäuse aufkleben kann und somit verhindern dass größere Staubpartikel in das Gerät eingesaugt werden funktionieren perfekt und passen aufs Gehäuse."
Razer Universal Quick Charging Stand for Xbox Series X|S: Magnetic Secure Charging - Perfectly Matches Xbox Wireless Controllers - USB Powered - Carbon Black (Controller Sold Separately),US$25.99,4.6,https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Razer-Universal-Quick-Charging-Xbox-S/dp/B09DHMXVN3/ref=sr_1_49?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xkm0kH5DkRAHwvFY7ZBCe3Pu4Qobte2p4nQVdb93cw1Mdmwjjo1Sh52pG0VitNm8leA_PVvlIwvKDQ4qiY10mv5YuXwBMW6KfasfZyEMMM2QCAliiveN9CrHXbEZHMNTP1kjmF2IdCYbEMgWWxbYBplmcBYWSJEXEMsKIlhDC0-9yKj-eMXkZZ_WLXNjyzdGYOsEswvr1ilqoB5dw5ny9rmAicqF-g6c0MyeAp3nUXk.0WkInoihowCI06tmQsEhzU6T-ej_AXmBS6Yu747KX4w&dib_tag=se&keywords=xbox&qid=1731040845&sr=8-49,"It just works and it looks good on the TV stand///1. The charger is deceptively small, which means it takes up less space.2. The build quality is solid and the black color matches perfectly with my default black Xbox Series X controller.3. Installing the battery was quite easy. Just add the battery pack and replace the cover.4. The controller sits nicely and securely on the charger without wobbling.5. The magnetic attraction between the controller and the charger works but it's not super strong. To give you a sense of it, the magnetic attraction is much weaker than between a MagSafe iPhone and it's charger. This means that when you place the controller on the charger, you don't get as much of a feedback that you've put the controller correctly on the charger. It's possible to put the controller on the charger in a misaligned way so that it doesn't charge. This is not a big deal as I explain in the next two points.6. If you correctly put the controller on the charger, there is an audible and satisfying click. Listen for this click sound.7. The lights work as expected for me. I know that other reviewers said that the lights didn't work as expected for them. Maybe, I got lucky but this is how it works: (a) The light is off if the controller is removed from the charger or if the controller is placed incorrectly on the charger, even when the charger is plugged in, (b) when you correctly put the controller on the charger and the battery is less than 100%, an orange light comes on (look for this light to ensure that your controller is charging), (c) if the controller is situated correctly on the charger and when the battery is 100% charged, then the light turns from orange to white.8. The battery pack gives me a good charge at least for now (I've only had this for a week at the time of writing this review). I can play up to 4 hours in one sitting with plenty of charger left. Though, I often take breaks and it's just more convenient to put the controller back on the charger during the breaks than to leave the controller lying around on the couch. But, this battery pack still loses more charge than 2 AA Duracell non-rechargeable, disposable batteries for the same amount of single session playtime. I guess that's a pretty common difference between rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries.In my opinion, this is one of the better controller charging stands of its type. As an example, I got a 3rd party (not Razer) PS5 controller charger and that looks uglier & cheaper (in plastic quality), takes up more space (though charges 2 controllers at once), and is more finicky/wobbly when placing the controller over it.///Can't go wrong///Looks good, charges good///Perfect upgrade for regular rechargeable batteries.///I have been using regular rechargeable batteries for my controllers for years, but there are still times where it dies mid-game because I forgot to charge them. This is the perfect upgrade. Easy to install the battery and cover and it is always charging between sessions.///Works great///Had this for a few months and I enjoy it!///perfect match///perfect stand for your xbox controller.///Great///Color matches my Xbox series x controller prefect.Was sick so did an all day gaming session, plenty of power to spare. Plugged into the back of the Xbox great for overnight charging.Note: I had to reorder since the first one came smashed box.///Easy charging///I love this thing wish I bought it earlier. Done playing a game just set on stand which locks in magnetically. Super convenient. Never have a dead battery again.///Seems to be of Good Quality///Works well. Comes with battery and two battery covers to fit various controllers. I have the standard Xbox x controller and had no issues. The charging station has some heft, so it won’t be knocked over easily. What I really like is the shape, it is contoured to match the shape of the controller which gives it a nice look. Plus, you can get several colours to match the colour pr of your controller. Still early days, but I may buy a second one for my white controller///Must have if you have an Xbox controller///I have brought two of these now and they are amazing great at charging the controller and endless battery life!Very happy with the product highly recommend it!///fits and looks great///The battery is very easy to install and does have a magnetic base. It has just the right amount of strength to hold it in place while charging and releases easily. I like too that the base is pretty heavy so it does not slide when you put the controller in or take it out.///Great solution for the Disposable batteries.///One thing that I Absolutely hate about wireless controllers is running out of juice and having to buy disposable batteries to keep playing.With the charging stand, I can just leave my controller charging the battery it comes with while I'm not playing and I will never running out of juice! And Even if I do, I can use the cable that it comes with to connect the controller to my PC and keep playing wired.It's an all around great buy if you are a heavy gamer.///Not bad///Looks good and does the job but I've gotten shocked a few times!"

I picked both the Xscreen and Case up.The screen is great. I don’t play my Series S much as I use my Series X mainly with a 4K monitor but this screen with the Series S are really impressive. Vibrant colors and dark blacks plus smooth gameplay! Tried a couple of games of Fortnite and played some Arkham Asylum during my testing.Sound. It’s quite loud. I had to lower it down to 3 out of 100 because it seemed like 10-50 (didn’t go past 50, it came preset at 50) it was just loud and louder.Extremely happy with the purchase we do a lot of traveling and this Xscreen has brought some new life back to my Series S as it will be joining us as we travel. The footprint of both the Xscreen and Series S is impressively small and I’m sure my family will enjoy consuming content (TV, movies, Ms. Rachel 🤣) while road-tripping. This was the main purpose of my purchase.I was also excited to see gameplay while connected to our EcoFlow River 2 would last me up to 3-4 hours depending on the game for some remote gaming.If you are looking for something that is super portable (thanks to the case) and need to game on the go the Xscreen would be a great addition to your Series S.///No Brainer for Series S Owners///UPspec really hit this one out of the park!  I wasn't sure on what to expect at first and was worried about this screen being to small for my liking - But the crystal clear picture & clarity in person is so refreshing in person and they nailed the portability aspect!  I purchased the traveling case from UPspec as well but truth be told you can honestly fit the whole thing in a regular travel bag :)  See my attached picture of a size comparison with the fat PS2 model for instance, crazy to think about how portable and easy it will be for me to travel now with my series S!  And the screen has adjustable reticles for gaming too which I didn't even realize giving you a visible crosshair in game!  You can tell the company made this product for gamers and have a gaming passion at heart.  Excellent product and I recommend this to anybody! Beautiful picture, and pairing this with a Controller Chatpad for the Series S quite literally turns your setup into a gaming laptop!///Perfect companion device to an Xbox Series S///This device has the fit and finish to make the xbox series s , the perfect travel companion.///Looks and sounds great///Looks clean a smooth hooked up to the Xbox series S.  Great picture, sound and quality!  I am glad I found something that works so good with the Xbox and super portable.  Very happy with the purchase!///Better than expected! With a large battery pack it'll let you take your Xbox ""off grid""///The Upspec Gaming xScreen is a portable display designed specifically for the Xbox Series S. It attaches to the Xbox's HDMI port and draws its power from the adjacent USB port on the back of the Xbox. This makes it possible to have the Xbox work completely ""off the grid"" if connected to a large power bank with an AC inverter. You can see it in action in my video review posted in the video section of the product page.Once installed you lose access to the ethernet port and one of the USB ports. But of course Wi-Fi continues to function and the Xbox has another USB port on the front. The display also allows for external storage to be connected to the Xbox's proprietary storage port.The display quality is impressive. It runs at 1080p at 60Hz, and while it doesn't support HDR or variable refresh rates, the image quality on the 11.6-inch display is decent and bright especially given the pixel density of this small display vs. a larger one. Colors are well balanced and the IPS display allows for decent viewing angles if you have some friends gathering around. The stereo speakers, although not extraordinary, are sufficiently loud for a portable setting.The brightness was very good for a USB powered display. While they did not list the specifications it appears to be in the 250 nits range. The input lag was acceptable, making it suitable for gaming. While it's not as responsive as a gaming monitor or high-end OLED television, it was much better than some of the projectors I've tested recently.In terms of build quality it's not a perfect. The white plastic does appear to match the color of the Series S, but mine had a slight gap in the plastic on one side where the bezel attaches to the rear display lid. Additionally my display was lacking one of the rubber feet that protects the Xbox when the lid is closed.One feature I appreciate is the ability to configure the display to turn off the Xbox when closed. However, lifting the display doesn't automatically turn the Xbox back on; you'll need to do that manually.And because the display is powered by the Xbox you only need the single power cord to boot up and play. I was able to run the Xbox / xScreen combination off of my  100Wh Anker Powerhouse power bank. How long your Xbox will run for will vary greatly based on how demanding the game is and how large of a powerbank is used.While there's room for improvement in build quality, the display itself is a nice accessory for Xbox Series S gamers looking to take gaming out of the living room. It feels like having a mini Xbox laptop that you can carry around. Just note it is only designed to work with the Series S, not any of the other Xbox consoles.///Great way to make an xbox portable///Screen fits perfectly to the back of the Xbox and doesn't add too much size and weight to it. Really happy with how it works and looks. Not 4k but that doesn't matter as the screen size makes the picture looks crisp. Sound is just ok but I don't expect much coming from the small speakers. I am concerned that if I close the lid shortly after I power the Xbox off the heat from the exhaust fan will damage the screen but it doesn't take too long for the heat to cool down.///The best portable gaming monitor for my Xbox Series S///Likes: it seems seamless like it meant to be with the Xbox Series S, able to travel around me on the road and on the go without no problem. Just carefully screw the latches on the side and align it up to the Xbox Series S, you're good to go! Worth 5 stars for quality of the boxing and presentation. So far, I'm very satisfied overall with Upspec GamingI'll definitely buy them again in the upcoming future but in black version for the carbon black version of the Xbox Series S. The picture quality is very good, not OLED nor it runs at 120 FPS. But it's enough for me and my needs."

This product has been a game-changer (pun intended) for my Xbox gaming experience.Pros:- Long-lasting batteries: The 4800mWh capacity is a significant upgrade from the standard batteries that come with the Xbox controllers.- Convenient charging station: The charging dock is sleek and easy to use, making it simple to keep my controllers charged and ready.- RGB lighting: The colorful lights add a fun touch to my gaming setup.- Compatible with various Xbox controllers: This product works with One, Series X|S, One X|S, and Elite controllers.Cons:- No significant cons, but the price might be a bit steep for some buyers.Overall, I highly recommend the Rysker Charger with Rechargeable Battery Pack to anyone looking to enhance their Xbox gaming experience. It's a great investment for serious gamers!///Fantastic Rysker High Capacity Battery///I'd been thinking about getting new Xbox controller batteries, since I've been gaming much more lately, and came across this set just in time. I've already given everything a good test, and really have no complaints, especially given the reasonable price point.I've had a great experience with the set so far. With a 4800mh capacity, it'll be a welcome change to those currently using smaller batts. such as a 2600mh, which need to be recharged daily for extended sessions. This 4800mh, would also be suitable for online players who don't want to worry about changing batteries mid-session, or someone who regularly uses the rumble feature on the controller.The first thing you'll notice about this set is its thoughtful design. It's sleek build looks attractive on your gaming shelf, or in my opinion, just about any shelf in your home. It's made of a hard plastic material, with a stable quality. It also has rubber feet at the bottom, so that it doesn't slip off surfaces.Due to its two-level design, removing the batteries from this station is quick and easy. The batteries themselves are also solid, and properly shaped for the Xbox X/S controller. The unit also features an on/off switch on the back, and nifty touch controlled multicolor RGB lights. It's great to see a product that pleases in both aesthetics and functionality!If you're still buying AA batteries for your Xbox controllers, this set would be a better option. You'll be saving money in the long run. I was hesitant to use this type of charging product a few years ago, but since trying them, I became a believer of the technology.This one is the best I've tried thus far. All four batteries charged up from empty to full, in less than an hour.  I also got about 30 hours of gameplay from a single battery. I find that very impressive, granted I've tried other charging sets that take much longer to charge, for less battery life.///Charge lasts a lot longer///I purchased these batteries after the last two pair I ordered went dead in less than a year. So far so good! They charge up really fast- and we love the changing colors! Once they are all charged up, you can turn a switch to keep the unit on or off (which is somehow easier for me to remember to turn off- the other ones would end up charging for too long because someone would forget which most likely lead to them dying so fast. Ahem. /so happy that there are 4 of these babies!///Short battery charge///There are a few things I like about this set and one thing I don't. The size of the charger is perfect & doesn't take up much room. I also like the led color lights on the base. The batteries are easy to put into the controllers and easy and quick to charge. The one thing I don't like is that these batteries' charge do not last as long as my previous xbox batteries. Unfortunately, that brand is no longer available. This is why I chose this set. I believe this will work for now but, I will be looking for a better set with longer charge.///Works great!///So much better than buying batteries! Highly recommend for the price! Quality built!///Long lasting/fast charging with great RGB!///These 4800 mWh packs for XBOX controllers have lasted through long gaming sessions over several days and charge lightening fast in the included charger.The charger features 9 beautiful RGB modes that you switch with a tap of the finger and looks great in my gaming setup.I appreciate the chargers overcharge/overheat prevention features which give the confidence to leave the charger on for the additional RGB in my setup.I definitely recommend these battery packs and charger and will likely by another to have more packs on standby for my XBOX controller collection.///This works great!///I love being able to just switch out a charged battery when the low battery notification comes on! With the four batteries included, I'm always ready to play! It takes up less space than a controller charger and is easy to use. Well worth the reasonable price I paid! I would definitely recommend this!///Vraiment au top///J'adore les meilleurs que j'ai achetés sur amazon achetés les sans hésiter.///C'est super !///Pour l'instant c'est super ! Fonctionne très bien. J'espère que le cycle de vie des piles est bonne. Nous verrons après quelques mois d'utilisation.///Great charger!///I had this item for about few weeks now and I absolutely love it. I like how small and compact it is compared to other chargers it doesn’t take up much space on my desk. It takes about 1 hour to fully charge a battery pack and they last about 8-10 hours of gaming and even if it the battery depletes on you, you can easily switch out and put on a fully charged battery since there’s 4 packs in totally which is very convenient to me, I love the clicky noise it makes when you put the battery back on the charger. there’s a display light which shows either it’s fully charged or depleted which is cool and the RGB lights on it makes it look nice with my whole setup. I’ll never need to buy batteries again. Would love if this came in pink!///They're ok///Would like it if I could use it with my OG batteries but there is a cut out on these that make it to where you can't charge any other batteries besides the ones that came with the charger.///Great///Works great"

We do game quite a bit, some days for hours on time, some days for just an hour. They hold a great amount of battery life. There is 4 of them so you will always have a good battery charged. I just plug the charging device into our Xbox and forget about it. We change them out when need be! Overall great item we have bought.///Great buy///Great looking charger, charges quickly, batteries last a pretty good time between charges.  It is a little tricky figuring out how to get the batteries in the first time but I promise you if they don't pop in easily they aren't turned the right way///Absolutely excellent!!!///This us the perfect set up for serious xbox controller gamers. The individual batteries last for multiple hour sessions over multiple days.The charging dock is excellent as well! I have absolutely nithing bad to say about this product. As a matter of fact I would rate it 10 stars if I could. You will not be dissappointed with this purchase, I assure you 👍😎///Handy, but short battery life///They are easy to charge, the stand works well and is easy to keep out of the way. Very easy to swap out and fit the controller well. But the life between charges is very low. I have 2 controllers, one using these and one using Amazon Basics alkaline batteries. The basics have lasted through 3 of these so far. So make sure to get the 4 pack.///Great battery life, easy to use///This rechargeable battery pack is easy to use and a must have for any gamer. The stand has a on/off function that can continuously charge the battery pack or you can turn off when you get a freshly charged pack. The batteries loose some battery life when not being charged but quickly recharge once turned back on. I've been using these since I got them and have had zero issues. Great item, great price and well worth it.///Nice quality///Works good for my controllers///Good quality///In my case, the battery life could be better ( 1 week or 2 in my case) but its no problem for me cause it has 4 batteries and I have 2 controllers.Good quality, looks good, works good for the price///Nice///Looking for something better than what I had and this hit it out of the park. Perfect for what I needed. Fits perfectly for all my controllers and looks nice///Works great saves money on batteries.///I was spending lots of money on batteries for me and my son. This product saved me a pile of money already. I will update my review if I have any future problems.///Erfüllt seinen Zweck///Macht was es soll. Akkus haben eine lange Laufzeit///Reliability///I tried other rechargeable batteries products and to be honest this one meets all my needs.  You need to check if this is compatible with your XBox controller as they are slightly different and this product may not be suitable.  I always check the reviews read the specifications to ensure you’re not disappointed.  Find it easy to slide the battery in the controller bit fiddly at first but soon got the hand of it."

He really likes it and uses it almost daily. It works great and has good sound quality as well. Fits good and can be worn for several hours without being uncomfortable. The lights are a cool feature as well. Very glad I went with these, great headset with a great price!///Amazing Headset! Phenomenal Deal!!!///Audio is great! Works exactly as expected! Contacted seller with a question and got an immediate answer that saved me! Last time I bought a cheap headset it was a big disappointment but this one’s legit and a total money saver!///Fragile but great quality///Great audio, the adjusters on the sides are a little finicky. Other than that, great product!///Sounds great!///The headset was super easy to setup, just plug and play.  It works great and sounds fantastic!///Reliable///This headset is durable and reliable. It has lasted way longer than my son's other headsets.///Crap! Bought two. Both broken. Don’t waste your money on it !!///This headset is crap. I bought it because of good reviews. However the first one we ordered arrived broken. So I ordered a replacement and planned on sending the first one back. The second one arrived and seemed to work ok. However within a few days it quit working. Same issue as the first set they sent. So it’s obviously a flawed product.Unfortunately I had a medical emergency that put me out for a month. I’m just now getting back on my feet but it’s too late to return either set. So I’ve been charged for two broken headsets that don’t work. Definitely bi-pass this product regardless of what their video and reviews show. It genuinely seems to be crap. Especially when it’s the same reoccurring issue of the microphone not working and broken wires 🤷‍♀️ like I said, the first one arrived this way. So it definitely was not user abuse in any way. Just really bad low quality product.///Fine for what it is.///This headset isn't very expensive, being only about $20-$25 dollars. The sound quality is fine, about average quality for gaming headsets in general. There are some main issues that I have noticed when I used it. First off, the earcups are solidly barred onto the device and adjustment can be rather stiff. Turning your head too much and given the leathery material that the earcups are made out of, it's not very breathable. My biggest complaint is that the microphone is rather quiet and the quality just slightly better than phone quality. Good pair if you need a quick gaming headset for cheap, but there are better options, such as fully USB headsets.///Super Headset///Das Headset sieht nicht nur optisch super aus, sondern leistet auch super Dienste. Ich nutze es für online Gaming spiele und bin mit dem Klang super zufrieden und zum Unterhalten während der Spiele auch bestens geeignet. Das Mikrofon und der Klang funktionieren super.Gutes Preis-Leistungs Verhältnis///SUPER CASQUE !!!!! Le son est très clair, nette et bien fort!!!!! Je recommande!!///Super casque!!!! Quand je regarde ma télé je n'ai même pas besoin de le mettre sur mes oreilles mais je le dépose sur mon lit en augmentant le son à fond et c'est super. Vraiment ce casque fait bien son travail et surtout le prix est très correct pour la qualité de ce casque. Je le recommande sans hésitation. :-)///Słuchawki///Słaba jakość i dźwięk///Ottime di buona qualità.///Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo adatte alle consolle PlayStation switch Xbox e pc dotato di uno spinotto a tre uscite audio stereo e microfono la luminosità LED è alimentata solo a pc da un uscita USB standard eventualmente su PlayStation con un riduttore micro USB. La fattura è ottima e anche la resistenza all’uso infatti è un dotazione a un ragazzino che la collaudata in breve tempo. La qualità audio è ottima e anche l’uscita microfono al suo pari non ho nulla da temere rispetto alle liste soggetti di marca che si possono trovare nei vari centri commerciali elettronica. Adatto allo scopo. Esteticamente molto belle."
